              "$t": "Zuko is a giant dork dog. This 2 year old, 50 pound staffie mix came to us on literally the last bus out from a south Florida shelter as Hurricane Irma was closing in and it was leave town or be euthanized, so we took the entire shelter population in. \n\nZuko is the happiest dog on the planet. He loves people, he loves dogs. He wants to play and he is happy, active and bouncy. Every day is the greatest day of Zuko's life and he needs a family committed to letting him do all the bouncing he wants. He is not the rocket scientist of the universe and he has zero ambition, but he is a sweet soul who loves life and he loves his people. His only knock is his too lustful stares at Karl the cat so he needs a no cat home. He will make an outstanding family pet. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at http: https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/a nd then email jen.lu@bigfluffydogs.com.\n\n. Our main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. NOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. All known information about an individual dog is provided in it's listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for:1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only \"hold it\" for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break).2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise.3.) Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home.4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded tenfold, for years to come.Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming, and can be expensive.All Dogs Require:Supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there."

              "$t": "Amelia is a 4 year old German shepherd mix weighing in at 100 pounds. Amelia lost her home because she was not good with livestock and in a farm environment, that's a problem. She was sad when she came to us because she loved her family, but she has rebounded nicely and is looking for her new home.\n\nAmelia is housebroken, walks well on a leash, has a lower energy level and is all around easy in a house. She is great with people of all ages and has lived with children. She is also great with dogs, including little dogs, who she also lived with. She is not fabulous with cats or livestock and she needs a cat free, no livestock animal home.\n\nAmelia is a perfect pet who will do well in the typical family home. Someone is going to love her. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please apply online, at http: https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/ and them email  audrey@bigfluffydogs.com. \n\nOur main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. NOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. All known information about an individual dog is provided in it's listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for:1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only \"hold it\" for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break).2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise.3.) Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home.4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded tenfold, for years to come.Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming, and can be expensive.All Dogs Require:Supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there."

              "$t": "Meet the dog with the most ridiculous name ever: Maraschino! She is a 4 yr. old, 45 lb, Pittie mix that we evacuated from a shelter in the path of Irma several months ago. She had obviously been someone's beloved pet because she had her own pink camo collar and pink painted toenails. She broke our hearts and there was no way we could leave her behind!\n\nShe is great with other dogs, and very easy-going. She loves to play, and when she meets new dogs her tail wags so fast it's a blur! She loves wrestling, and playing chase, and playing fetch (either with you or all by herself).\n\nShe has been great with all of the people (and kids) she has met, happy and affectionate. This girl has never met a stranger and wants to be everyone's best friend! She loves butt scratches and will happily show off her twerking skills in exchange for a good scratch. This girl is a typical happy-go-lucky Pittie, and is as sweet as her name!\n\nShe's not so great with cats however, so this is a no-cats kinda girl! \n\nShe is medium to high energy and does best with a few long walks or play sessions per day, and then is perfectly content to cuddle. She will even wait for you to come tuck her in under a blank for her naps. She still pulls when on leash, although her foster family is working on this with her.\n\nShe already knows her basic commands, is trustworthy in the house, is crate trained and potty trained. This girl is seriously perfect and deserves her new forever home!\n\nIf you have an open spot on your couch and think Maraschino would be a fun name to call outside in your robe and slippers, please go to our website and fill out an adoption application (link below)! \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please FIRST apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/\nOur Website www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the adoption process. If you still have questions, you can reach out to corey@bigfluffydogs.com.\n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT ALWAYS RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION DUE TO THE SHEER NUMBER WE GET DAILY. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE MIGHT NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\n* BEHAVIOR DISCLAIMER: We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. All dogs will require supervision with children, other dogs, and cats/other animals regardless of whether or not we have stated that the dog is friendly towards kids, cats, other dogs, etc. Slow introductions to other animals in the home, and allowing for them to have a separate space will make for better relationships in the future. Most dogs need an adjustment period when transitioning into a new home and there may be potty accidents, even if we have stated the dog is housebroken. All dogs should be somehow confined separately (crate or separate room) when left home alone until you can be sure the dog is trustworthy left loose. Separation anxiety can manifest if a dog is left alone more than it is used to in it's new home. This can be worked through and we are here to help. Please do not give up on your new dog without reaching out to us first!"

              "$t": "Lucia was rescued from a very rural shelter where she ended up when her owner died. She wasn't in great shape and she has spent some time with us getting healthy and adjusting to life as a beloved house pet. She has made great strides in her foster home, and although she is still shy, she now appreciates the company of people and enjoys getting affection and attention. \n\nShe gets along well with other dogs who are mellow like her.  She ignores cats and has been fine living with them.  She has been around children and does fine with them as long as they are passed the screeching years and can respect her space. (Thinking 8+ is best)\n\nShe walks well on leash and she enjoys slow strolls. She would also LOVE to have a fenced yard to patrol. She is crate trained and potty trained and is trustworthy left loose in the house as long as there isn't a steak left on the counter. \n\nShe will never be the life of the party, but she is sweet and will repay people's patience with steadfast love and loyalty. \n\nIf you are interested in adopting this dog, please FIRST apply online, at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/\nOur Website www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the adoption process. If you still have questions, you can reach out to corey@bigfluffydogs.com.\n\nNOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT ALWAYS RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION DUE TO THE SHEER NUMBER WE GET DAILY. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE MIGHT NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \n\n* BEHAVIOR DISCLAIMER: We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. All dogs will require supervision with children, other dogs, and cats/other animals regardless of whether or not we have stated that the dog is friendly towards kids, cats, other dogs, etc. Slow introductions to other animals in the home, and allowing for them to have a separate space will make for better relationships in the future. Most dogs need an adjustment period when transitioning into a new home and there may be potty accidents, even if we have stated the dog is housebroken. All dogs should be somehow confined separately (crate or separate room) when left home alone until you can be sure the dog is trustworthy left loose. Separation anxiety can manifest if a dog is left alone more than it is used to in it's new home. This can be worked through and we are here to help. Please do not give up on your new dog without reaching out to us first!"

However, she thinks she's 2 in the playful pup mind set. Her former life has caused her to have a lot of trust issues. Especially in/with other dogs. She must be placed in a home where she w/b the ONLY pet. She is as loving and wonderful as she is gorgeous. Is GREAT on a leash and loves walks. American cheese slices are her fav treat, she'll do anything for cheese. Really! Isn't there someone who wants to give Jolie a warm loving furever home. PS, she gives wonderful kisses too, but won't howl for anything and rarely barks."

If you're a new car buyer you may be considering the Volkswagen Atlas minivan.  For Big Fluffy Dog lovers, Atlas is a 2.5 year old Anatolian/GSD cross. That's the one we'll talk about today.  \n\nAtlas is basically a giant puppy.  Although we have no doubt that he'll be able to bear the weight of the world on his shoulders (this guy will be 100+ pounds), we're not sure he wouldn't try to toss it up in the air and catch it, too.  Atlas has the high prey drive and energy common to GSDs.  Atlas may be best suited to a home with any other dogs.  If you are a  cat free home with older, sturdy (remember, he's 100+ pounds of puppy) children and think this guy is for you, please email audrey@bigfluffydogs.com after you fill out the adoption application at https://bigfluffydogs.com/adopt/adoption-application/\n"

She was rescued by a man who gave her to his brother and his wife, but she had illness and wasn't able to walk her or take financial care of her.    Hannah is a needy little girl.  She NEEDS someone who can have her with them all the time.  She's good with other animals but we want to adopt her into a home with no young chidlren who may steal the lime light from her, and maybe only one other pet that will love her so she has a buddy.   \n\nShe's not crateable, she's not interested in toys or anything other than her people.  She loves long walks, she's really needing a fenced yard and a pet parent who's active enough to walk her often and be home with her or be able to take her along with them.  She just wants to lay on you, makes it a little hard to get things done but she just needs a best friend.\n\nShe's only about 17 pounds.   No apartment or mobile home parks will be considered. She likes  a quiet household during this time.  Call or text me at 517 294 4514 or email me at marlas2468@yahoo.com  She is a sweetheart and deserves the best treatment after all she's been through."

              "$t": "This is sweet Mona, originally she was Kona.  Mona has a heartbreaking story. \n\nShe came in as a 10 month old owner turn in.  She was VERY high energy and the shelter didn't want to try and place her.  I was able to get her out of the shelter and Jen who was a runner, was very excited to find a young dog who had the energy to run with her daily.  \n\nJen and Mona became very tightly bonded as a pet parent and her little girl.   Last year Jen was in a very high speed car accident, she was run off the road coming home from work and went under a semi.  Jen broke her ankle and her back. Mona was devasted seeing Jen coming home from the hospital and she didn't leave her side. \n\n\nJen and Mona had to move home to Jen's parents home, losing her job, her apartment and was bed bound for nearly a year.  Mona needs to be run daily, she has a lot of energy and Jen was having her parents exercise Mona hoping she would soon recover.  \n\nMona was by Jen's side constantly and became her nurse maid.  After two failed surgeries to repair Jen's spine and ankle, recently came the news Jen was not expecting to hear.  Only 25 years old, Jen will not be recovering any time soon if at all.  The surgeons can't seem to get her surgeries to heal her ankle and her spine might need more time than they had projected.  Without Mona Jen wasn't sure she could pull through, but now it's been more than a year and Mona is getting very impatient with the slow recovery and Jen's parents can not exercise Mona enough to keep her happy.   \n\nJen has decided it could be years IF she does recover.  Devasted she has decided it's best for her little girl to go to a pet parent who can continue her daily runs, without that outlet Mona gets anxious and can get out of hand.  With the exercise she's a angel.  \n\nWe are looking for a non smoking home with a VERY active runner or hiker who can be home with her, or working from home.   She needs property to live on and she is NOT good with other animals but is good with older children. \n\n  She is VERY faithful to her person and she'd do great with agility or having a job to focus on.  She's good with people, adults, and she's somewhat of a rare dog.  She's a Kelpie mix, about 45 pounds, tons of energy. This website didn't even have Kelpie as a breed you could choose to list him.\n\n Kelpies are working dogs, so those kinds of herding dogs need a job to do or they get bored.  She's three years old, loves car rides, and she's cute as a button.   She's housebroken loves being a inside pup, but LOVES long walks through the woods or runs on trails.  She could be exercised by jogging along a bicycle or keeping her pet parent in shape.   \n\nIf you think you would love a faithful rare breed pup who will be your best constant companion, please call or text me at 517 294 4514.  Or email me at marlas2468@yahoo.com   Jen will be extremely sad to lose Mona, she has been dealing with this decision for nearly a year now and she's come to grips with the fact that sometimes, if you love someone enough, you have to do what is best for them.  Mona has waited a long year for Jen to recover and it's been very tough on her to sit by and watch Jen lay in bed.  Jen says she never has loved anyone as much as she does Mona, that Mona is her best friend ever.   Mona desparately needs a person or couple or family with young adults to become her new family and enjoy her, she's had a tough go of things. \n\n\n"

              "$t": "This is sweet loving Freddie.  He is a awesome little Westie mix.  \n\n He has been through so much.  He was unlucky enough to be put into a rescue a few years ago who did not place him in a safe home.   He was a two year old healthy dog with a rescue who carelessly placed him in a family they did not follow up on or monitor during his first placement days and didn't find out till years later that he was in a deep neglect situation.  \n\nThe family notified the rescue a year ago, that they no longer wanted to keep him.  When the rescue went to go check on the situation a YEAR later they found he had been isolated, not cared for or loved even. His nails were SO long and over grown, he was having trouble walking. He was feed horrible unhealthy dog food and given all kinds of in appropriate foods that were not even fit for a healthy human. \n\nRight now the rescue who originally placed him doesn't want him back or to rehome him.  This is a issue with large rescues, they want the fast, easy to place dogs and do not always stand by their placed dogs. \n\nTogether the rescue and the owners had decided not to do anything with him but have him put down.  He was depressed and needs simple love and care and this is where I was called in.  \n\nFreddie started off as a happy healthy doggie and we are HAPPY to report her is once again. Luckliy Freddie is a very happy now, my what a little love can do....  During this neglect he lost his sight, it's tradgic ........he is learning to deal wtih the world on the hand he's been dealt with.    He has started wanting to play, he's lost weight and is moving so much better and just enjoying life again.\n\n'He loves to be talked to, belly rubs, long walks and just being with you.   He's even great with cats and kids that are about seven or older.  Ones that understand not to come at him too fast or blind side him.  He wants to play with kids for short periods, so for someone with Grandchildren who visit often he'd be fine.    He does learn the house and does quite well in navigating.  Freddie has turned into a wonderful and loving dog again.  He's attentive, gets aroun quiet well. \n\n  We have done all his vetting  and he's healthy after all, thank God.  He's overweight and dropping the pounds quickly.   With each passing day he is more perky and loving.     He's about a third of the way to his weight loss in only three weeks. \n\nFred needs someone who needs someone to care for and accept the love he wants so desparately wants to share.  He's awesome wtih cats and would be in heaven to have a larger older dog to hang with.  A bigger dog, older dog, to be his eyes and someone to interact with on his level, the floor.   A safe fenced yard where he can roam off leash and follow his nose and roll in the grass to his hearts content.  He doesn't get on furniture and he can't manuver a colonial house or home with a lot of stairs.  He can do a few, but many would be dangerous for him. \n\nHe should be back to his normal weight of 15 pounds or so soon.  If you think you can open your home and heart to a dog who is so much in need and can be a great little companion for someone.  He needs tenderness, love, exercise and a lttle time.  If you think Freddie sounds like a soul you would like to be involved with helping save and maybe adopt your self, call or text me at 517 294 4514 or email me at marlas2468@yahoo.com\n"

Zeke is a sweet boy, good with dogs, and kids, he's a Shepherd Husky mix.   Five years old, 60 pounds.  We need to get him into foster care or a adoptive home immediately.   A non smoking home.\n\nCall or text us for info if you can take him into your world and give him the love he's used to having.   We have him up to date on shots and he's ready to go. He'd be best off in a home with a yard and someone who has time to be with him, we will not consider apartments or trailer parks.  \n\nCall or text 517 294 4514 or email us at marlas2468@yahoo.com"

              "$t": "Sally is a special girl who has been through a LOT!!  She is slow to trust and does not like loud noises. She breaks our hearts because she is a dog whose spirit has been broken and the sadness in her eyes said it all. Many people have worked with her and she has worked hard to become more comfortable. She loves walks and just running around with her person but does not like being left outside - probably a result of having been kept outside full time in previous years. We will be adding more about her later, but will be looking for a quiet, calm, indoor home for this sweet girl. She is nonaggressive but does not really play much - other than with her daughter Sophie sometimes. She does smile on command if she's relaxed.  She is well behaved and obedient in the house now. She does like the security of a crate as her bed and looks for it when she comes in.  She loves to eat.  She rarely barks.  We think she is around 5-6 years old and weighs about 65 pounds.\n\n She has had at least 3 large litters (13 in one) as her previous rescue said they could not catch her to spay her for a while. When we got her, we also got the surviving \"children\" from her last litter, who were 1-2 years old and some were running wild, and the others were confined in outdoor pens full time. Most were not socialized.  Sophie is the last of her litter and the two are together currently. \n\nPlease text or phone 734-645-7705 for more information. Sally's adoption fee is $200 but may be negotiable to the right home.  Sally has been with us since June 2013. :-((\n\nNO CATS FOR THIS GIRL! !  (She will kill them).  She is good with other dogs and is more comfortable with another dog her size around."

              "$t": "PLEASE READ BELOW IF INTERESTED IN THIS DOG! \n\nIF YOU ARE SEEING THIS LISTING, THEN THE DOG IS STILL AVAILABLE AND WE ARE PROCESSING INQUIRIES FOR ITS NEW HOME. We remove them immediately once we have stopped taking inquiries and have a pending home.\n\nPLEASE FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS BELOW TO BE CONSIDERED. Please provide a contact phone number! Once we narrow down to the top three candidates, we usually call them to discuss details and then make our choice to meet the dog. Those who send no information about your home or family, or just ask is the dog available, how much, or how old will not be answered. All of that information is listed here and unfortunately, due to the volume of inquiries asking those basic questions, we are unable to answer all of the emails and texts. We also get a lot of people who send in the basic question because of the cute factor and really are not ready to adopt yet.\n\nWe understand that some of this is due to the new Petfinder \"format\" with their basic question at the bottom and apologize for that. In addition we are getting duplicates from most people because of Petfinder's new system which is making it difficult to tell if your inquiry was sent to us. Also the Petfinder \"new system\" asks for a zip code or location but does not forward that to us so we cannot tell your location. We are getting a lot of complaints from prospective homes trying to navigate Petfinder's new system and unfortunately we cannot do anything about their new format and the removal of the information on our home page, etc. Someone there obviously thinks all the pages should look the same and have removed the individual aspects of the system. Many people are simply sending their information to us directly at petangels@gmail.com or via text or voicemail to 734-645-7705 which may be a simpler solution at this point. \n\nPosted 2-23-18:\nWe will try to get new pictures of this girl soon.  These were taken the day we brought her to the foster home and she was nervous and afraid and unsure why she was being taken from her old home.  They do not do her justice!\n\nJurie is a purebred German Shepherd and is in great shape for her age.  It's hard to believe she is a senior as she does not act her age at all.  Jurie is about 9 years old and finds herself in need of a new home to love her as much as her previous owners do.   Jurie was a spoiled \"only child\" for 7 years and then her humans had a two-legged child!!  Unfortunately for everyone, Jurie was never socialized well around babies and she doesn't understand.  She has a typical prey drive that some of the German Shepherds can display and she tried to nip at the baby as it was trying to crawl.  Didn't hurt him but the second time it happened was enough to caution the parents and force them to choose between the safety of their son and their dog.  Being a senior dog too, we feel that they did make the right choice.\n\nWe were cautioned that Jurie has not been around a lot of other dogs either and may not be good with them.  We have been moving slowly with her but she is in a foster home with other dogs and cats and is integrating well.  She was nervous at first and we still don't leave her unattended but she is able to mingle fine with supervision.  She tends to retreat to her crate if she gets nervous.  She has actually made friends with a lab there and now has a buddy she is comfortable with.  Jurie has great house manners and is well trained to commands - some in German.  She is housebroken and crate trained.  She is a very loving dog and a great companion.  \n\nWe have listed her as not good with children, dogs, or cats due to her history.  However, we want potential adopters to also understand that she is NOT a vicious dog or one that will lunge or go after other dogs, etc.  She can be walked without issue and has done well going into pet stores, etc.  She has greeted older children and adults fine.  She also listens well and if there is any concern (such as when she met our 4 lb chihuahua with a major attitude, who thinks he weighs 100 pounds!) and she is told to \"leave it\" she immediately responded and walked away.\n\nShe is in great health but can be prone to skin allergies if she is off of her medicine or given low quality food.  She does not display any arthritis or hip problems.  She loves to go for walks and takes stairs in stride.\n\nIf interested in adopting, please call or text 734-645-7705 and leave your name, location, brief summary of family, work hours, dog experience, training and exercise plans, and a phone contact number.  You may also email us at petangels@gmail.com with the same information.\n\nAdoption fee is $250 (cash with receipt or Paypal), possibly negotiable to the right home.   Any excess fee above her direct expenses is used to support the other seniors, abuse and neglect cases, and adult dogs working through issues and training in our rescue.  Thank you.\n"

              "$t": "UPDATED 2-23-18:\nMonica has been in a new foster home for the last couple months and is doing very well.  She has learned to integrate into the home.  The consensus is still that she would probably be happier as an only dog as she wants attention for herself, but she might also be able to go to a home with another compatible dog.  She does not have experience with children and tends to bark at them.  Please call 734-645-7705 for more information on Monica if you think she may be a good fit for your home.  She is now going outside to do her business and no longer uses the pee pads.  She is fostered in Ypsilanti.\n\n12-24-17:\nMonica has settled in some now and is learning our routine and experiencing new things and we thought it was time to update her listing.\n\nWe have removed her from the special needs category as we are finding her to just be another baby needing love. She is good with the cats, good with other dogs her size, still a bit nervous around the big dogs but getting there, and good with gentle children. She still is nervous with loud noises or yelling.\n\nShe is quite reliable on per pads but is also learning to go outside now. She mainly just wants to be by you and on the couch or chair with you!!\n\nOriginal listing:\n\nMonica just lost the only mom she ever knew who passed away unexpectedly.  She is very insecure and craves love and attention but is afraid to accept it when she first meets. She was nipping at another dog in the house and trying to crowd in for attention.  The family members cannot keep her.\n\nShe is very nervous in the car and we think she was rarely taken anywhere.  She eventually calmed some after about an hour once held tightly in a blanket but had severe anxiety.\n\nShe is trained to pee pads. \n\nShe needs a very patient home that will help her to trust and socialize and will be home with her a lot.\n\nShe will watch out the window and bark at people or cars. She would not be well suited to apartment living due to her loud bark.\n\nShe is an excellent watch dog.\n\nPlease call or text 734-645-7705 if interested in giving Monica a home.\n\n"

              "$t": "PLEASE READ BELOW IF INTERESTED IN THIS DOG! \n\nIF YOU ARE SEEING THIS LISTING, THEN THE DOG IS STILL AVAILABLE AND WE ARE PROCESSING INQUIRIES FOR ITS NEW HOME. We remove them immediately once we have stopped taking inquiries and have a pending home.\n\nPLEASE FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS BELOW TO BE CONSIDERED. Please provide a contact phone number! Once we narrow down to the top three candidates, we usually call them to discuss details and then make our choice to meet the dog. Those who send no information about your home or family, or just ask is the dog available, how much, or how old will not be answered. All of that information is listed here and unfortunately, due to the volume of inquiries asking those basic questions, we are unable to answer all of the emails and texts. We also get a lot of people who send in the basic question because of the cute factor and really are not ready to adopt yet.\n\nWe understand that some of this is due to the new Petfinder \"format\" with their basic question at the bottom and apologize for that. In addition we are getting duplicates from most people because of Petfinder's new system which is making it difficult to tell if your inquiry was sent to us. Also the Petfinder \"new system\" asks for a zip code or location but does not forward that to us so we cannot tell your location. We are getting a lot of complaints from prospective homes trying to navigate Petfinder's new system and unfortunately we cannot do anything about their new format and the removal of the information on our home page, etc. Someone there obviously thinks all the pages should look the same and have removed the individual aspects of the system. Many people are simply sending their information to us directly at petangels@gmail.com or via text or voicemail to 734-645-7705 which may be a simpler solution at this point. \n\nUPDATES 3-16-18:\nWe were able to speak with  Barneys previous vet and we learned that his birthday is 4-27-06, so he is almost 12 instead of 14!!  He is quite physically fit and he got his shots updated and was heartworm tested negative. \n\nPosted 2-22-18:\n\nBarney is a 14 year old chocolate lab who was left behind when his owner passed away.  He is an older boy but in great shape and does not act his age.  He loves to just follow you around and be near you.  More on this boy coming soon. \n\nIf interested in adopting, please call or text 734-645-7705 and leave your name, location, brief summary of family, work hours, dog experience, training and exercise plans, and a phone contact number. \n\nAdoption fee is negotiable to the right home (cash with receipt or Paypal)."

He is a purebred chihuahua but his father is larger.  King could be up to about ten pounds full grown but has short legs like his mother.   Mom is the small chihuahua shown in the background in the picture.  He is very shy at first and will need patience to bring him out of his shell.  He has a very submissive nature due to the dominant nature of his mother.  He does well with other animals.\n\nIf anyone is looking for two chihuahuas and has an appropriate home, King and his mama Lily would like to go together but Lily is not good around children and strangers and generally prefers women over men.  We realize this makes her more difficult to adopt and we will certainly consider adopting them separately so that King is not held back from getting a home due to her issues.  \n\nKing has been training to pee pads so far and will need further work on housebreaking.\n\nIf interested in adopting, please call or text 734-645-7705 and leave your name, location, brief summary of family, work hours, dog experience, training and exercise plans, and a phone contact number. \n\nAdoption fee is $395 each (cash with receipt or Paypal). Spay/neuter agreement must be signed to be completed by 6 months of age."

This wiggly and happy girl oozes sunshine out of her every pore. Pebbles is the star of any party with her winning smile, waggy butt, and her great party trick of flipping over for belly rubs. Nothing makes her smile more than a good snuggle session or a good game of fetch. If Pebbles has one flaw, it's that she loves people so much that she doesn't want to share her people with other dogs. Pebbles is currently living in one of our wonderful foster homes. Adopting from foster is easy! Please email adoptions@hshv.org or call (734)662-5585 to arrange to meet Pebbles today! Pebbles can't wait to be your very best friend. "

At 3-years-old, Bowzer is still getting used to the indoor lifestyle. He's a little aloof when it comes to the slippery floors and looks like a chicken on wheels, but we are slowly working with him. He loves to go for walks, cuddle with his favorite people and show off his adorable self. Bowzer will need a home without small children (preferably under 12) where he can continue to learn his basic manners, release all that energy he needs to burn and be the dog he's always wanted to be. If you are interested in learning more about Bowzer, he is available for adoption today! "

This wiggly beefcake would love to go to a home where he can get showered in the love and attention he deserves. If your ideal evening includes snuggling on a comfy couch watching Netflix, Neno just might be the dog for you! Neno has heartworm which means that this dog has parasitic worms in the right ventricle of the heart and nearby blood vessels. Heartworm is transmitted from one dog to another by mosquitoes and can be easily prevented using monthly heartworm preventative, but once the disease is contracted the treatment process can be quite intensive. Neno will need to remain sedentary with minimal activity during the treatment process to ensure a healthy recovery. There is additional information on heartworm disease and treatment available at our Adoption Desk. "

He Is Currently Being Treated For Hookworm And Has One Pill Left To Take And Should Be Good To Go. What Can I Say About This Goofball. He Is Amazing! Hes A Big Ole Baby! He LOVES Everyone He Meets And Has No Issues With Strangers Or Kids. He Has Not Shown One Ounce Of Aggression At All. He Hasnt Been Socialized Around Other Animals And Has Proved To Be A Cat Chaser. Nelly Has Been Slowly Introduced To The Resident Dogs And Over Time Has Come To Accept Them And Is Able To Now Be Part Of The Pack. Im Not Sure How He Would Be With Other Dogs, It Would Take Take And Work To Put Him In A Home With Other Dogs.  He Loves Kids Though And Has Really Enjoyed Hanging Out At My 10 Year Olds Football Games On The Weekends.He Is On Point Trained. He Has Never Once Had An Accident Or Marked In My Home. He Will Walk Right Into His Crate When I Say \"Bed Time\". He Knows \"Sit\" And \"Stay\" And We Are Working On Doorway Boundaries. He Has Some Bulldog Pushyness And It Mostly Comes Out When He Wants To Snuggle. He Does Not Take No For An Answer. Ive Been A Human Shaped Dog Bed More Since We Have Been Fostering Nelly Than Ever Before. He Just Cant Seem To Get Close Enough To His People. He Is A 55# Lap Dog. He Does Also Like To Climb. As You Can See In His Photos He Enjoys Sleeping In The Cat Tower. Weirdo Dog! We Will Be Looking For At Least A 6 Ft Fence As He Can Climb A 4 Ft No Problem. We Have Kept Him On A Lead At Our Home. He Does Pretty Good Off-Leash As Long As You Are Paying Attention To Him And Has Excellent Voice Recall. Ill Make This Promise. Ehoever Adopts This Boy Wont Ever Give Him Up. Hes Hilareous And A Joy To Have Around. His Bad Habits Are Minor And Are Workable. One Last Note Is His Tongue. We Arent Sure If Its A Birth Defect Or Trauma But He Cannot Atick His Tongue All The Way In His Mouth. This Does Make Him A Bit Of A Drooler At Times. It Doesnt Bother Him But Will Need To Be Paid Attention To On Cold Winter Days. He Eats Fine Although Can Be Messy With His Food Bowl As He Eats From The Side Of His Mouth. He Also Can Only Give Kisses If You Happen To Be On That Side Of His Face. His Adoption Donation Is $260.  For more uodates, pictures, and videos of Nelly please \"LIKE\" us on facebook.

              "$t": "Neptune is a 1 year old mountain cur/ possibly beagle mix. He is a total sweetheart. He can be hesitant with some men but warms up. One of his favorite things is snuggling with his foster dad. He is good with otuer dogs and is pretty playful. He hasnt been around cats but is pretty submissive. He is pretty much potty trained but could use a bit more training on consistency. He is neutered, up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative, and microchipped. He has been treated for worms and has had a fecal test done. He can be a bit skittish so may be better with older or calmer children. Walks well on a leash and likes car rides. If you would like to see kore pictures and updates you can check him out on our facebook page facebook.com/allforkarmaanimalrescue. To apply to adopt Neptune please go to our website at www.allforkarmaanimalrescue.com. his adoption donation to the rescue is $260"

This boy is one of the most handsome of the bunch - our pictures just don't do him justice. He is a beautiful chocolate red male who has some of the most stunning physical definition we've ever seen. We're thinking he might be a good training partner for a Navy SEAL or maybe someone training for an Iron Man competition - we challenge you to keep up with our D-Man!\nDalton is a good boy in his crate and loves car rides and playing fetch. He is definitely a high energy boy who will need to go to an experienced bully home. Did we mention he's got a remarkable vertical leap? Dalton would probably do best paired with a submissive female or as an only dog. As far as people go, he loves everybody - he'll bounce up to your eye level just to show you! He will greatly benefit from anybody willing to give him the training and extensive exercise that he needs.Dalton is recommended for a home with children over the age of 12 and will require a fully fenced yard.**Before meeting any Buster dog an application must be completed.http://thebusterfoundation.rescuegroups.org/forms/\n4/1/18 12:09 AM"

They were living in the garage while the workers fixing up the house were desperately trying to find someone who could help them. And we couldn't leave them living in a garage, now could we?!\nRusso (pronounced Roo-So) is a nice guy who has been through the wringer. He has done extremely well with our volunteers working on his manners and he definitely aims to please his people... but he will still do best with someone with Bully Experience because he can still be a bit stubborn. He does well with most other dogs, is great in his crate, LOVES to play and loves to cuddle. He is a volunteer favorite and he will make the right someone a great dog!Russo is recommended for a home with children over the age of 12 and will require a fully fenced yard.**Before meeting any Buster dog an application must be completed.http://thebusterfoundation.rescuegroups.org/forms/\n4/1/18 12:09 AM"

Now this girl is healthy, happy, and plump. This fun girl likes to be on the go whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a car ride, a walk or run, or just playing ball. However, Gemma is also content just to hang out and cuddle, or chew her nylabone. She loves people and she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even great with kids. This beautiful girl will make you smile over and over again if you let her into your heart and home. If going to a home with another dog, she will need to work on certain behaviors and continue with training.

She plays with several of her foster dogs, including jumping the smaller fence to play with a few of her favorites (so she would do best with a privacy fence). She is working on her obedience and leash handling skills as well as her manners. She has a lot of potential and with the right owner we know she will soar! She does well with several other dogs and enjoys the water (and is a natural swimmer, or belly flopper!) as well as running around and playing. She really needs a foster home that can provide her more attention and continue to work with her. She is a short but stocky little thing and has the most beautiful color! She has been treated for heart worm and is now negative. She will be required to be on year round heart worm preventative no matter what, but other than that is good to go. Nova is recommended for a home with children over the age of 12 and like all Buster dogs requires a fully fenced yard, a 6' fence is strongly suggested as she can climb a standard fence.\nNova is a very sweet girl that came to buster out of the drug raid and was living with two other dogs that she seemed quite attached to\nNova is Buster's newest girl. She is a little shy around people, but does warm up. Unfortunately Nova is heart worm positive. She really needs a place to relax while she receives treatment for this. Until she is treated for heart worm she will not be able to begin training because of the strain it will put on her.\nTO foster or adopt Nova please go to www.thebusterfoundation.com**Before meeting any Buster dog an application must be completed.http://thebusterfoundation.rescuegroups.org/forms/ 4/1/18 12:09 AM"

Working on reactivity and barking with new dogs and people. She enjoys her walks across the street at our gracious neighbors house. Joslynn is a happy, playful and lovingly sweet girl. She will need a family or individual committed to continuous training and work on social exposure with her. Ideally Joslynn will blossom with an experienced owner that understands how important it is that she gains confidence and trust. No cats for this robust beauty. And currently we say no kids and definitely a fenced yard. If Joslynn continues to do well her requirements for adoption may change. For now this is what we need for her. Joslynn will still be getting her training and exercise in. Please share our diamond in the ruff Joslynn came to Buster in early December, she is unable to be accessed as when we received her she was expecting. December 23rd she delivered two healthy puppy girls. She did a wonderful job taking care of her pups & her wounds from before she came to Buster have healed up nicely. Joslynn is beyond ready to put her past behind her & spend her life in a loving, responsible home!Joslynn is recommended for a home with children over the age of 16 and will require a fully fenced yard. Buster feels she would do best in a home where she is the only pet.**Before meeting any Buster dog an application must be completed.http://thebusterfoundation.rescuegroups.org/forms/ 4/1/18 12:09 AM"

She walks awesome on a leash she knows a vocabulary of commands. She love love loves the water she loves taking baths she loves playing in the water. She has the most awesome personality. She's a couch potato that also gets bursts of energy. She came to us in 2015 under weight with a shattered hip and a tumor on her toe running the streets with her son Buddy (whom has since been adopted). We fixed up her hip took the tumor off her toe and she is fit as a fiddle. She's not a barker unless she's talking back to you and to trying get you to do something she's silly like that. I own a cat and she's fine around her as long as we are watching and the cat is dog Savvy anyways so she knows to stay away and not to pester. Oh and she loves kids too. She is so very deserving of a loving family of her own so she doesn't have to share with the foster siblings. Please if you have a fenced-in yard love in your heart and room on your bed and couch this girl is for you!!!I can always count on Missy to make me smile. This gorgeous girl is wonderful with other dogs, cats and adores kids! Missy had a lousy start before coming to us. She and her traveling companion Buddy were picked up by a great guy who cared enough to stop and get them both in his car before the could have been hit by a car on a major road. You may remember Missy had a shattered hip and a large mass that we had surgery on. She is on the mend and doing very well. Please help us share this beauty (both inside and out). She really needs a family of her own. Whoever is fortunate to find their way to her will not be disappointed!** All Buster dogs require a fully fenced yard.**Before meeting any Buster dog an application must be completed.http://thebusterfoundation.rescuegroups.org/forms/ 4/1/18 12:09 AM"

Thank you to his rescuer for not turning your back on him. This wonderfully loving and sweet boy is about ten months to one year old, still a bit underweight and I'm guessing him to be about 50-52#. With some fading scars on his muzzle and right thigh, and he's heartworm negative! So what's now left? With any luck a forever home for this guy. I adore his fabulous head and face.As with all Buster dogs, Bouncer is recommended for a home with older children and will require a fully fenced yard.**Before meeting any Buster dog an application must be completed.http://thebusterfoundation.rescuegroups.org/forms/ 4/1/18 12:09 AM"

              "$t": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Vegas is an active little lady that loves toys, flirt pole, car rides and snuggling in bed. No cats or small kids, please. Vegas is 44 lbs and 2.5 years old. She has been through basic obedience training (sit, lay down, recall). Vegas has moderate to high food drive, moderate toy drive and high prey drive (aka she is squirrel crazy!). Great potential for dog sports! Vegas would also make a great jogging buddy. She is selective with other dogs, prefers males. Vegas would do best as an only dog or with ONE compatible male dog in the house. Please, no homes with multiple dogs or other female dogs. Adoption fee is $200 (which will be donated back to the Buster Foundation!). Vegas is spayed, up-to-date on all shots, heartworm negative, microchipped, and crate trained. If interested please fill out an adoption application or contact her foster mom at: pitbullsoul@gmail.com or 313-702-5501 if you have questions. 4/1/18 12:09 AM"

              "$t": "Ms. Josephine is quite the sophisticated older lady! She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 10 year old small breed mix with all the traits needed for being a lady of leisure in her golden years. She knows you get more love with honey than vinegar and is always ready with a cheerful greeting for friends and strangers alike. Josephine learned early on that you need to keep yourself healthy and still enjoys taking brisk walks during the day to keep herself in shape. She has a few mild age related health concerns but knows keeping her spirits up is the key to living a long enjoyable life. She adores food and treats but has excellent table manners and even when she occasionally snorts she always excuses herself to be polite. Josephine also knows the importance of friendships. She enjoys spending time with her best friend Kalie and would love a home where they both would be welcome. Ring us today to meet Josephine (and Kalie); she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spayed, vaccinated and micro-chipped. Call Friends of Michigan Animals Rescue at 734 461-9458 or visit our website fmar1.org for more information. 4/14/18 2:32 PM"

Upon checking Tink, it was found that she was 10 years of age and although they tried to breed her, instead she had mammary tumors and was very underweight and scared. Like the butterfly that morphs from a caterpillar, Tink has shed her sadness and her shyness and has learned to live each day fully and her progress has been both in the physical state and most importantly her mental personality that has blossomed. She is a favorite of all that meet or care for her and our hope for Tink is that she finds a solid foster or forever home where she can show her new found zest for life."

I did have a racing career (70 races) and was also a mom to 8+ pups. \n\nMunchkin is a sweetheart. She takes a few days to warm up but than isn't afraid to ask for attention or treats. She is also a slow eater and took a week before she ate a full meal without bribing. She likes to play with toys and the other hounds and loves the kids to the point of being a little overwhelming if they are too small. She loved playing with our 13 year old grandson, him giggling and her tail wagging. \n\nShe does stairs with ease and has no trouble with the floors. She thinks she might like to try being a guard dog, giving a little woof when she hears a strange sound after dark. She is good on the leash and rides well in the car after you help her in. She is not cat safe. She still needs to be tested around small dogs and other breeds of dogs."

People tell me I have the most beautiful mahogany color and amber eyes. What do you think? I keep amazing my foster mom at how smart I am. I learned to \"sit\" on command in just 2 days! Mom says I'm a total love bug. I can do slippery floor and I think after a couple more times, a flight of stairs will be easy-peasy! I love to play with all the toys and even helped my foster mom out by surgically removing every squeaker from every toy - it's much quieter now.\n\nI love children but mom says I'm a bit overwhelming for little ones. I really do not like cats! Tiny dogs are ok if they're calm, but maybe medium ones would be better with me. If you have a fenced yard, I would just love that, however, I do walk very nicely on lead and would love to meet new people. I keep looking or my new mom or dad....are you the one?"

My foster dad says I'm a real snuggler because I am! I can do slippery floors and even stairs with no problems. I love children, but I'm better with bigger ones, cuz I sometimes forget and knock the little ones down (even though I don't mean to). I love to play with a ball and my mission is to rid the world of squeakers in all those stuffies. \n\nMy foster dad says I'm a little strong on lead but there's so much to see and to smell! I can \"sit\" on command and am very food motivated and want to learn more. Will you teach me?"

I had a pretty good racing career (139 races) and now am ready to begin the next journey in my life.....a pet for that special someone. My foster mom thinks I am a real special boy. I have mastered going up the stairs working on the down part now....mom's stairs are kinda steep so she has to hold my collar and tell me slow so I don't skip any stairs. I am a big boy and a big lover. I love to be petted and cuddled. I did well with all the kids I met and they all liked me too. I do like to play with toys and don't try to shred them to pieces like mom's grey does. \n\nI am cat safe and did really well with the cats in my foster home. So I will do good in a home with cats and even other breeds of dogs too. I am looking for that special someone....could that be you??\n\n"

I had a leg injury which ended my career before it even started. My leg is doing great and I am now ready for that new home.\n\nI am super sweet and pretty calm for being so young. I would do well with pretty much anything.....I did okay with the chickens in my foster home...if that tells you anything, however I did have a problem with the cats. I love to play with toys. I have had work on the leash and love to go places with my foster mom. Everyone thinks I am so handsome and I tend to agree. I am ready for my new home....could that be with you?\n"

She takes treats very gently and asks to be petted instead of demanding. She also enjoys laying in laps when invited. She is a slow eater but does enjoy eating. She has very good house manners and doesn't chew inappropriately. She likes children but isn't overwhelming with them. Jammer can do stairs with ease and has no trouble with tile floors.\n\nShe is good on a leash and rides well in the car. She does require help to get in the car but jumps out just fine. She is not cat safe and would prefer to be with her own kind....she loves greyhounds...some call her a greyhound snob. Jammer may be okay as an only hound especially if she is with a family where someone is home most of the time.\nI am really sweet and might do well as an only dog.  I am doing great in my foster home and already have mastered the stairs in my foster home.  I don't have problems with shiny floors and have no problems with housebreaking.  I do love toys and being by people.\n"

I would rather play with my friends than chase the artificial lure. Now I am getting ready for that next phase in my life that as a pampered loving pet.\n\nI am very shy and am working on gaining courage in my foster home. I will want a special family that won't mind working with me to bring out the best I can be. Because I am timid I like to take my time to get to know you. I will never be a meet and greet hound but I may be a hound that thrives in my home surroundings. I do tend to warm up to women a little faster...so a new home with a patient mom would be wonderful for me.\n\nIf you have a lot of love and patience I will be the grey for you.\n"

I am a big sweet boy that is super lovable. I tested not cat safe....I just like to chase them too much. \n\nI am doing great in my foster home. My foster mom says I really like to cuddle. I am her big shadow and follow her everywhere....I will be your shadow too. I do like to play with toys and did really great at the meet and greet. I really liked the people and loved cuddling with them. I would do better in a home with a fenced in yard....I prefer not to potty on lead but in my own back yard."

Unfortunately his human Dad and buddy passed away and his loving human Mom has physical limitations and can no longer walk and exercise him so he is being surrendered back to Homeward Bound. \u00c2\u00a0Rusty weighs approximately 35 pounds, is crate trained and is house trained. \u00c2\u00a0Rusty is a purebred Shiba Inu and true to his breed. \u00c2\u00a0 He can get protective with things he should not have (sticks he picks up on walks for example) but since he is very fond of cheese he can be easily distracted.  He will make a nice addition to the right home. \u00c2\u00a0What would be best for Rusty is a home with a stay at home parent or someone not gone a lot, the only pet, no children and someone who has Shiba Inu breed experience. He does well on leash but he really enjoys a fenced in yard where he can play a lot of ball fetching, investigate and just sit and watch what is going on around him. \u00c2\u00a0\nOur adoption radius is within 60 miles of Canton, MI as home visits are required for our pets prior to placing them in their new forever homes.

              "$t": "Additional photos will be added in the next few days\n\nPenny is a 4 year old mini Dachshund (approximate dob 9/11/13).  Homeward Bound rescued her from a puppy mill when she was 5 months old.  A couple with 3 other Dachshunds and 3 cats adopted her.  Due to a divorce they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep all of the animals. She is a very sweet little girl who LOVES to be held by her person.  She loves to sleep all night on the bed with her person(s) in her snuggle sack.\n\nShe was born completely deaf and with tunnel vision.  She now, sees very little but that and being deaf does not stop her love of life. She is used to going outside throughout the day to go potty and play so; she needs to go to a home where someone usually is home and not working outside of the home.  She can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be cage trained as she will immediately go potty in the cage when she is put in one.  She will go on the pee pad in a designated part of the home if no one is home to let her outside.  It would be best that the home not have small children as she is getting used to losing the rest of her sight.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please copy and paste the following \"online application\" into a new email to homewardboundmi@yahoo.com and then simply answer the questions.

              "$t": "George was born on 12/3/2012 and weighs about 44 pounds.  He was originally adopted from Homeward Bound as a pup and since then his family situation has changed and they are no longer able to spend the time with George that George needs.  He is very smart, loves to play and cuddle, house and crate trained and good on leash. He is good with other dogs, only children 14 and above and he does not like cats. He does not like the water (ie lakes, pools).   George needs a home where someone will be home more than gone, able to give him the attention, time and exercise he needs, no small children.  He will make a nice addition to the right family.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting me, please copy and paste the following \"online application\" into a new email to homewardboundmi@yahoo.com and then simply answer the questions.

And of course, providing love and security to a special orphan at a difficult time in their life when they have lost their former family and home.

              "$t": "Sam is a handsome, deaf, 2 year old merlequin Great Dane.  Sam is super sweet and loves to meet new people (especially men). He is a puppy still in some ways and an adolescent too, so he needs someone with experience in Dane puppy raising and the preference would be for a home with experience with obedience training with a deaf dog. His ideal family would be calm but assertive and very consistent as he does try to push his limits like a typical adolescent boy. Sam is pretty darn smart and learns quickly. He does require structure and boundaries, just like all puppies. \n\nWe are looking for a home with a fenced yard,  so he can run, do zoomies and play. Sam gets along very well with the other Danes in his foster family, but they are a little too old for his rough housing, so a dog buddy under 5 years old would be ideal. Sam cannot resist chasing the cat, so a home without cats would be best. He has lived with kids before and was good around them. Older kids would be best (12+) because Sam does have some food allergies and get can sick from certain foods. Since being in foster Sam's allergies have not been a problem, so he's not receiving any allergy shots.  He is receiving fish oil for dry skin and shedding. \n\nSam likes to be outside but does get sunburned, so a nice shady yard and dog sun screen would be appreciated. He loves his people and does have a little bit of separation anxiety so a family that has someone home most all of the time would be wonderful for Sam. He was crated quite a bit at his previous owners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 home and he is not fond of it. In foster he has been crated up to 3 hours and he is OK with it, but it does stress him.\n\nHe loves walks and car rides. He pulls a little bit on his leash so he is working on this with his foster, but continued obedience is part of the adoption contract. \n\nI think he will adjust easily into a new home. It only took about 5 days here."

              "$t": "Holly just turned 8 years old. At 55 pounds, she is UTD on her shots, spayed, been on heartworm preventative and microchipped. As a special bonus, she has a tail!! She is completely house trained as well as crate trained. Holly is a survivor and looking for a very special home.\nShe came to us over a year ago with lots of fear issues that resulted in snapping. She did not want to be touched, her feet were extremely sensitive, she pulled on the leash, wanted to chase cars, was disturbed by the headlights, did not like car rides, did not tolerate grooming and in general had many behaviors that would indicate something happened in her background. While we do not know the actual details, she either was completely ignored, mistreated, bullied by the other animals in the home or a combination of these. With calmness and patient guidance, she has improved immensely. She can now be touched, petted and likes belly rubs. She loves to be by her people and rests quietly on the couch next to you. Her front feet can still be a bit sensitive and brushing is not her favorite, but she does come to you for love and attention all the time. She was shaved down at the vet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office under anesthesia as the visit to the groomers was just too traumatic for her. Grooming is still a challenge for her. \nShe loves attention from calm adults. A quiet home setting with a fence would be ideal. Holly enjoys being outside and is quite playful with her balls and toys. If we are out with the other dogs, she will gently take the balls to a corner of the fenced in play area until she has them all. We retrieve them for all the dogs and play the game again. She can tend to be a bit bossy, letting the other dogs know when she thinks they are not behaving. Holly has been in foster the whole time with several other OES. An electronic fence will not work for her as the shock collar will only add to her distrust of her new family.\nHolly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s progress will be slow, and she may never be that dog that is eager to interact with strangers. New experiences can tend to be a threat to her and new things need to be presented slowly. With calm consistency and understanding, she will love her home and the adults in it. With commitment and love, this little girl will become a wonderful companion. Do you have what it takes to be Holly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hero? \n"

              "$t": "Eleanor could not be a sweeter dog.  She is a black Great Dane and will be 7 years old in May and is up-to-date on all her medical needs.  She is wonderful with our kids and immediately got along with our lab mix and terrier mix.  She has never met a stranger and in the month we have had her we still have not hear her make a peep.  She is house trained and although she was crate trained at her previous home we leave her out in the house when we are gone with no issues at all.  Eleanor is an absolutely perfect dog but has some special needs that her adopter needs to be aware of.  Eleanor has epilepsy that is easily controlled with medication that she receives twice a day.  The medication can be purchased at any pharmacy and here in Ohio it costs $38 per month to maintain her dosage.  She has not had a seizure in the 2 months she has been in foster care.  At some point in her life her epilepsy was not well managed and she suffered a series of seizures that have apparently left her with impaired vision.  The ophthalmologist is not totally sure how much she can see but at minimum it is obvious she can see shapes as she navigates well around our house with little to no help.  With that said she does not do well with stairs and would likely do better in home with carpet, although our house is hard wood and she has done well.  We do have small rugs around for our own aging dog and those help with her navigating.  She will make a wonderful addition to a home that is willing to give her the extra attention she deserves."

Hannah sleeps in crate, but would prefer the couch\nWalks Nicely on a leash: Pretty good. Working on distractions that cause her to pull.\nKnows Basic Commands:  Yes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Sit, Down, Shake, Wait, Leave It.\nEnergy Level: Medium\nSpecial Needs:. \n\nArrival Story:  Waggin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Tails answered a plea from a shelter to get this girl into rescue because she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t handling shelter life well after being relinquished by her family due to a divorce.\nApproximate Age/Weight: 5 years / 85 lbs.\n\nPersonality:   Hannah arrived at Waggin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Tails in a pretty stressed state of mind.  There was so much change and not much structure in her life, but with help from her foster family and a good trainer, Hannah has made great progress in becoming a confident, balanced dog.  \n\nShe is a smart girl who was looking for guidance from humans.  Hannah is treat motivated and \u00e2\u0080\u009cworks\u00e2\u0080\u009d for her meals (stuffed kongs, snufflemat, food puzzles) now.  Hannah knows basic commands, is crate-trained, and has great house manners. \n\nSilly, playful, and will never turn down a good game of fetch, Hannah will be happy to curl up with you afterwards for a nap on the couch.  Hannah is friendly, affectionate, and enjoys chewing on toys, but never anything inappropriate.  \n\nOur fun girl enjoys swimming, boating and drinking from a garden hose on a hot day.  Walks make her happy, and she has now learned to check in with eye contact while walking. Hannah can be cautious of newly introduced things in her life. She will thrive in a structured (but not rigid) home environment where she knows what the routine is. \n\nForever Home:  Hannah is a beautiful dog who won over her foster family immediately.   She would do best in a low-key home, but would love to be part of a family who will teach her new things as she is a smarty pants.  She enjoys interacting with humans and will want to be near you.   Hannah has great house manners and knows to wait at doors, gates and stairs.\n\nHannah gets along with and enjoys walking with her male canine housemate, but can be selective when it comes to other dogs.  We know Hannah would prefer to have you all to herself!  Due to Hannah's size, a family with older children suits her best.  \n\n Fenced yard only.  No invisible fences, please.\n\n\nContact: Please contact wtdr2008@yahoo.com if interested in adopting Hannah.\n\nIf you are interested adopting a dog, please download an Adoption Application from our website,www.waggintailsdogrescue.org/adoptionprocess.html and email it to wtdr2008@yahoo.com.\n\nADOPTION INFO:\n\nWe do not have a facility; all of our dogs are fostered in private homes.

He is a sensitive and super sweet boy who enjoys baby-talk, responds to his nickname, Moosie, and loves getting pets.  He's a super snuggler who loves attention and affection, but is content to relax quietly in the company of his people when they are busy doing people stuff. \n\nMoose is not a jumper and has good house manners. He enjoys playing with dogs his size who he's come to know and trust.  He does better with slow introductions to new dogs until he feels comfortable.  Moose would also do fine as the only dog in the household as long as he is surrounded by affection, attention and love. He loves older children and is a great companion for them. \n\nMoose prefers walking on quiet trails and country roads as opposed to city streets, which can make him a little nervous.   \n\nMoose overall is a loving, easy-going boy who just goes with the flow and enjoys the companionship of his family.  \n\nForever Home: Moose will need a family willing to give him some time to adjust to a new home, routine, and continue his loose-leash training.  He'd do well with a canine companion his size or as the only dog soaking up all the love. Moose would do well with older children who know how to respect dogs.  Moose requires a fenced in yard and a home without cats.

              "$t": "Good with Kids: We are looking for a home without young children\nGood with other dogs: Yes\nGood with cats: He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never bothered the resident cat\nHousetrained: Yes\nCrate Trained: Yes\nWalks Nicely on a leash:  Yes \nKnows Basic Commands:  This smart guy knows the basics - sit, shake, give\nEnergy Level: Medium-High\n\nSpecial Needs: Since Earl has allergies, he will need to stay on medicine year-round.  He is on two meds that will cost approx $100 per month.  \n \nArrival Story: Earl came to Waggin Tails after his previous owners were unable to take care of him.  He has allergies that had gotten out of control and this poor guy was pretty miserable.  Waggin Tails has been able to find some medication that controls Earl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s itching.  He is very nervous at the vet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found a great vet who gently works with Earl to ease his fears using fear-free methods. \n \nApproximate Age/Weight: 7-8 years / 72 lbs.\n \nPersonality:  Earl is a super smart and sweet dog.  He makes his foster parents laugh every day with his antics!  He was a superstar in his training class and graduated with flying colors!    \n\nEarl LOVES to play fetch!  Tennis balls or other dog toys, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter.  He will bring the ball back to you or set it down near you non-stop.  He will also point at it so you know exactly what he wants.    When playtime is over, Earl does settle down nicely for naps - even if the tennis ball is still in his mouth!  \n\nThis smart guy loves to go for walks and has learned to walk nicely on leash.  Good boy, Early Bird!\n\nEarl likes to cuddle up and get belly rubs.   He has great house manners, too!\n\nHe would make a great agility, free-style dance or possible dock diving dog - he would do really well with some kind of job or sport.  He is wicked smart and food motivated, so he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very easily trained and would rise to the challenge.  He really enjoys learning new tricks!\n\nThere are three other dogs in his foster home and Earl gets along with all of them.  He doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to engage in play with them, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also not opposed to settling down next to one of the other dogs and chewing on a Nylabone.  He has shown no interest in the resident cat, but is interested in squirrels and birds in the back yard.\n \nForever Home: We would love to see Earl go to a home with some dog experience and a fenced in yard so that he can run after tennis balls/toys safely.  After all that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been through, handsome Earl needs to be with someone who is willing to give him the attention and playtime that he deserves.  While Earl behaves nicely around children, a home without young children is ideal.  If you're looking for a super fun and funny guy, he may be the one for you!\n\n\nContact:  Please contact wtdr2008@yahoo.com if you're interested in adopting Earl.     .\n\nIf you are interested adopting a dog, please download an Adoption Application from our website,www.waggintailsdogrescue.org/adoptionprocess.html and email it to wtdr2008@yahoo.com.\n\nADOPTION INFO:\n\nWe do not have a facility; all of our dogs are fostered in private homes.

She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an expert!  Roxie is a little bit on the shy side but comes out of her shell to run around the yard with her canine bestie, Gibson, and play with her favorite toddler, Noah.  She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s learning the basics in her foster home and is treat-motivated.  Our pint-sized cutie can get into trouble without proper supervision as she does like to chew.  A young dog craves mental and physical stimulation so we know Roxie would thrive with a pet parent who likes to play, provides chew toys, and go for walks.  Miss Roxie has also proven to be a crate-escaper.  Nothing a few extra hooks or zip ties hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t solved.\n\nRoxie is good at the vet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office and a little unsure about car rides.  She likes other dogs but is very cautious so a confident, laid-back canine pal would be ideal for her.\n\nForever Home:  Roxie is looking for a person / family with a gentle nature like hers that would enjoy some fun, walks, and most of all, cuddles!  No electric fences, please.\n\nContact: Please contact wtdr2008@yahoo.com if interested in adopting Roxie.\n\n\n \nPre-Adoption Application:  To be considered for a dog, it is best to submit a pre-adoption application.  The pre-adoption application can be downloaded from our website - www.waggintailsdogrescue.org/adoptionprocess.html.  Just complete the application and email it back to wtdr2008@yahoo.com\n\nWaggin' Tails Adoption Information:  Waggin' Tails Dog Rescue has a standard adoption fee of $225 for adult dogs.  Different adoption fees apply for older dogs, small breeds and puppies - $125 for senior dogs (9 years +) , $275 for small breed dogs and $250 for puppies, plus a $50 deposit which is returned upon proof of spay/neuter.  Our adoption process includes an application, vet reference checks, and a home visit. Waggin' Tails Dog Rescue does not have a shelter facility.  All of our dogs are fostered in private homes.  To meet a dog in person, please see our event calendar on our website at www.waggintailsdogrescue.org for the latest information.  Arrangements can be made to meet our rescue dogs outside of Saturday adoption events after an approved application is submitted.  This application does not imply an obligation to adopt by the applicant or by the rescue group.  Our volunteers have made rescue a second job that they do in their spare time after coming home from full-time jobs.  E-mail inquiries are the quickest way to obtain information about a dog. Thank you for your support of rescue and your interest in a rescue dog!"

              "$t": "Good with Kids: Unknown but not reactive.  \nGood with other dogs: Yes but plays rough\nGood with cats: No\nHousetrained: Yes\nCrate Trained: Yes\nWalks Nicely on a leash: Pretty good\nKnows Basic Commands:  Yes.\nEnergy Level: Medium \nSpecial Needs: N/A\n\nArrival Story: Waggin' Tails found Gizmo at Detroit Animal Care and Control.  After meeting and playing with Gizmo, we knew we had to help this happy dog find a great new family.\n\nApproximate Age/Weight: 3 years / 50 lbs.\n\nPersonality:  Gizmo is a silly, playful little bundle of brindle happiness.  We met him at the shelter where he won over one of our volunteers during a play session.  Gizmo has a gentle mouth and takes treats gently and drops toys easily.  He loves toys, eating meals out of Kongs and chewing on bully sticks. He does act puppyish and still sometimes mouths hands when playing (no biting, just mouthing) so we're working on that.  He graduated from Training Buddies, Mind Your Manners class.  \n\nGizmo has had a DNA test and we discovered that he is 78.5% American Staffordshire Terrier with 12.% of mixed breed identifiable as only parts of the sporting, hound, and mountain dog groups.   Gizmo is a svelt 50lbs full grown.\n\nGizmo has good house manners and hasn't played with anything other than his toys in the house.  He took to crate training easily. \n \nGizmo is a fun dog who really enjoys time with people, is making good eye contact and checking in with his handler on walks. He is a leaner, and will curl into you for some pets or sit on your lap for snuggle time.  He would love to sleep with you and provide warmth on cold nights.  Giz is great at morning snuggles!   Our boy is adventurous and likes to explore and follows his nose wherever it goes. He wears a harness on walks. Gizmo is good on car rides but needs to be secured or he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be trying to drive.   Gizmo is treat-motivated and wants to learn and is super smart.  He is more busy-body than couch potato and likes to know what is going on the house so he is happy to tag along when you do chores.  He is not much of a barker and likes to sit at the front window and watch the neighborhood goings on.  Gizmo doesn't bark at people or dogs passing by.\n \nForever Home: Gizmo could fit into many different home situations.  He would likely knock over a little one with his bouncy, happy-go-lucky nature so older kids would be best.  He is young and still needs a good amount of playtime.\n\nContact: Please contact wtdr2008@yahoo.com if interested in adopting Gizmo!\n\nIf you are interested adopting a dog, please download an Adoption Application from our website,www.waggintailsdogrescue.org/adoptionprocess.html and email it to wtdr2008@yahoo.com.\n \nADOPTION INFO:\n \nWe do not have a facility; all of our dogs are fostered in private homes.   We generally have two adoption events per month.  To meet a dog in person, please see our event calendar on our website for the date and time of the next adoption event. Arrangements can be made to meet a dog outside of Saturday adoption events after an application is submitted and approved.\n\nOur adoption process includes an application and in-home meet-n-greet with the dog.\n   \n-Adult Dog Adoption Fee - $225\n-Small Breed Adoption Fee - $275\n-Senior Dog Adoption Fee - $125\n-Pup Adoption Fee - $250 plus $50 spay/neuter deposit refunded upon proof of surgery by 6 mos.\n \nEmail inquiries are answered faster than phone inquiries.\n\nThank you for supporting dog rescue and your interest in a rescue dog!"

              "$t": "I did some time at the River Rouge shelter.  I was relinquished after having a litter of pups because the other pregnant female in the home and I squabbled.  It was a bad situation.\n\nLet me start by saying that I am much more beautiful in person.  It is hard to capture the essence of my soft brindle coat until you meet me in person.  And, just wait until you stroke my silky ears while we cuddle!   I am the best at cuddles.  And, playing fetch!\n\nI am sound sensitive and a bit of an anxious dog but I know there is a special person/couple that will see past that and cherish all of the unique gifts I have to offer as a 4-legged companion.  I know basic commands and have good house manners.\n\nSo, here is the nitty gritty\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I hear all and would like to bring everything to your attention because you do not hear things as well as I do.  I would make an excellent watch dog, alerting you to when squirrels, or other danger, is near.   It takes me time to get to know and trust humans, but once I get to know you, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be friends for life.   A home without a lot of visitors is ideal for me.   I can be apprehensive in new situations, but with your guidance, patience, and some high-value treats I know that we can do anything together.   I currently live in a close-knit suburban neighborhood and it is probably a little too much for a dog like me.  My best defense is going on the offense (barking) when in the back yard, when neighbors or other dogs appear so I will need help from my humans to redirect me and help build my confidence.  I can be choosy about my dog pals and I like to chase cats but I do currently live with both.  \n\nI am a hoot at playing fetch and I have learned so many fun things in my foster home.  Playing ball is what I like most!   Chain link fence?  I can hike over that easily so I need to be monitored outside or have a privacy fence.  You put a cheeseburger on the ground in front of me and I will wait patiently until you say I can have it.  Cheeseburgers are my favorite!  No, wait.  Playing fetch is my favorite.  We can figure this out later.\n\nForever home:  A quieter, adult-only home is ideal for me.  I would love to be your canine security officer!  When off-duty I enjoy fetch, chewing on a bone, following humans around the house, and then settle down for snuggles when the Netflix comes on.  While I am not a good fit for the first-time pet parent, I do just need a special someone to take a chance on me.  No electric fences, please.\n\nPlease contact wtdr2008@yahoo.com if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in making me yours.  \nLove, Diamond\n\nDiamonds DNA test stated that she is:  25% Amer Staffordshire Terrier, 25% Dog de Bordeaux, 12.5% Bullmastiff, and 12.5% mixed breeds from the Guard Group in the following order - Boston Terrier, Boxer, Great Dane, American Staffordshire Terrier.\n\nADOPTION INFO:\n\nWe do not have a facility; all of our dogs are fostered in private homes. We generally have two adoption events per month. To meet a dog in person, please see our event calendar on our website for the date and time of the next adoption event. Arrangements can be made to meet a dog outside of Saturday adoption events after an application is submitted and approved.\n\nOur adoption process includes an application and in-home meet-n-greet with the dog.\n\n-Adult Dog Adoption Fee - $225\n-Small Breed Adoption Fee - $275\n-Senior Dog Adoption Fee - $125\n-Pup Adoption Fee - $250 plus $50 spay/neuter deposit refunded upon proof of surgery by 6 mos.\n\nEmail inquiries are answered faster than phone inquiries.\n\nThank you for supporting dog rescue and your interest in a rescue dog!"

              "$t": "Arrival story:   These three pups (one female / two males) were born while in the care of a Waggin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Tails foster home.  Their mom, Eve, a shepherd mix, was pulled from Detroit Animal Care and Control and surprised us with her buns in the oven.  Eve has a sweet disposition and has been a great, playful mom to her babies.  All three pups are typical for their age in that they are still working on housetraining and learning not to chew things they shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\n\nAge:  10 weeks old as of 4-3-18 and 14-16lbs. each (anticipate pups will grow to medium size).  All are up-to-date with age-appropriate vaccinations.\n\nREBEL  (female, black and white) loves to snuggle but will tell you when has had enough.  She is a quick learner and loves to play with toys.  Rebel can be unsure in new environments but will warm up with your reassurance.  She has a moderate energy level and knows sit.\n\nSCAMP (male, black with speckles) is always up for adventure. He loves exploring new places and things. He definitely let's his curiosity take over sometimes and will need a tour guide at all times.  Scamp has a moderate energy level and has attended puppy daycare and knows sit.\n\nRASCAL (male, brown and tan) is always on the go. He loves to play with toys and keeps himself entertained. He will need some work on socializing with new dogs appropriately but loves to meet new dogs and people.  Rascal is the last pup to settle down for a nap and the first one up.  He has a go-go-go energy level, has attended puppy daycare and knows sit.\n\nForever Home:   Are you ready for a pup?  They are a lot of work! Our young pups are looking for loving and dedicated people/families to teach them all the things young pups need to learn to become well-mannered, confident, canine companions.  \n\nContact:  Please contact wtdr2008@yahoo.com if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in adopting Rebel, Rascal or Scamp.\n\n   \nPre-Adoption Application:  To be considered for a dog, it is best to submit a pre-adoption application.  The pre-adoption application can be downloaded from our website - www.waggintailsdogrescue.org/adoptionprocess.html.  Just complete the application and email it back to wtdr2008@yahoo.com\n\nWaggin' Tails Adoption Information:  Waggin' Tails Dog Rescue has a standard adoption fee of $225 for adult dogs.  Different adoption fees apply for older dogs, small breeds and puppies - $125 for senior dogs (9 years +) , $275 for small breed dogs and $250 for puppies, plus a $50 deposit which is returned upon proof of spay/neuter.  Our adoption process includes an application, vet reference checks, and a home visit. Waggin' Tails Dog Rescue does not have a shelter facility.  All of our dogs are fostered in private homes.  To meet a dog in person, please see our event calendar on our website at www.waggintailsdogrescue.org for the latest information.  Arrangements can be made to meet our rescue dogs outside of Saturday adoption events after an approved application is submitted.  This application does not imply an obligation to adopt by the applicant or by the rescue group.  Our volunteers have made rescue a second job that they do in their spare time after coming home from full-time jobs.  E-mail inquiries are the quickest way to obtain information about a dog. Thank you for your support of rescue and your interest in a rescue dog!"

We do not have a central facility. If you want to meet any of our adoptables please submit an application.\n\nStacy was found on the side of the street one day in April. I went out to help save her and found her laying there helpless. We got her to emergency where we got her comfortable. She was later transported to port Huron where she had her broken hips fixed. The accident did leave her with a partial paralyzed front paw. She does still use it to pull herself up. She is such a love bug and very happy just to have someone to lay with. She is great with men, kids, and woman. She just isn't great with other animals. She does like my male pit but she is kept separate with my other dogs. Lacy has come so far from last April. She is happy, healthy and strong. Her bad paw doesn't get in her way of getting where she wants to go. She is gentle when taking food from you hand.

Her previous owner adopted her along with her littermate at six weeks of age. After 2 years her sister was put to sleep because he showed signs of food aggression. Within 3 weeks of her death her old owner got another puppy. It was only a matter of time, before there were some fights, and because she was larger it was decided that Nadia would be put to sleep. That was when a rescurer stepped in and rescued her from certain death. Nadia is house trained, can sit and shake hands. She loves to play with her beloved toys. She loves to cuddle and give kisses. She does NOT do well with other animals or small children. She does well on a leash but would prefer a fenced in yard. She needs professional nail trimmings, and I am not sure how she would do with a bath. She is up to date on her vaccinations, and she is a good girl.

I'm little and spunky and have the cutest ears on the block!\n\nI love playing, going for car rides, learning and trying new things.

I'm a friendly guy but children move too fast for me and they make me nervous :( I love my family though and enjoy being with them! I am a tall dog and I weigh 85lbs and I have HUGE up ears. I know my basic commands such as sit and come. I also know \"go to your crate\". I like my crate and don't mind being in there while my foster family is away. I am quiet and calm in there. I enjoy being around other dogs and I love to play but would also be fine being an only fur kid. I am good in a fenced yard and also good on a tie out so a fence is not needed. To be honest, I would fit in almost anywhere including an apartment. I like to play with a ball or rope toy but I am a pretty laid back guy and would also be fine as a couch potato. I have seen a professional trainer as well so some of the hard work has already been done for my future family.

              "$t": "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.\nSTAR is a foster-based rescue. All our rescue animals stay in foster homes until adoption. We do not have a central facility. If you want to meet any of our adoptables please submit an application.\n\nSPONSORED FEE: Kasey's Adoption Fee has been sponsored.\n\nHi, my name is Kasey. I came into my foster home emaciated, full of parasites, with an extremely bad UTI. It's taken me awhile to get back to health, but I'm doing so much better! We don't know how long I actually had a UTI that was left untreated, but due to this, I do leak urine. We are currently still working along side the vet to see if this will be a life long issue.\n\nI was very loving and friendly when I came into my foster home, but I was very withdrawn. I have come so far! I am still skittish because of some things that must have happened to me in my past. I don't care for garbage trucks, or thunder, and when my 10 year old human brother gets rowdy with his toy weapons and such, I get very nervous. However, I have never growled or attempted to bite anyone. I just go hide by my foster Mom when I get nervous or scared.\n\nI love to play with my foster sister who is an Airedale Terrier. We play great together and have a lot of fun! We are great buddies! I would love a home with a very friendly buddy that gets along with everyone as I do.\n\nI really do need a fenced yard. I do have greyhound in me, and if I got loose, I would probably make it very far away in a short time! I walk pretty well on a leash, and I will go potty on leash. I also need to have a martingale collar kept on me, because like a greyhound, I can slip a collar easily. My neck is wider than my head.\n\nI didn't really care for the crate for a long time. Maybe this was because of being stuck in the cage at animal control. My foster Mom has worked with me, and I am much better. I am crated when the family leaves the house. At night, I will sleep on my dog bed, on the bedroom floor all night long with no problems.\n\nI am very smart! I already knew how to sit,lay down, and shake. My foster Mom says that someone could probably train me to do much more!\n\nI have MANY greyhound traits! If you've ever been around a greyhound, when you meet me, you'll see exactly what I mean! My Mom thinks my most prominent Belgian Malinois trait is my bond to one person in the home. Which is my foster Mom! Don't get me wrong, I love everyone else too, she just happens to be my favorite! Oh, and I have a big, tuff bark! I will surely scare someone away if you need me to! I do like to be a bit bossy to my Airedale sister sometimes. If she starts barking, I will go put her in her place. I sound like I'm being mean to her, but I don't hurt her, I just try to tell her to knock it off! Luckily, she's as friendly as she is, and just tries to ignore me. Mom gets after me when I do this, and I'm getting a bit better with it.\n\nI don't think I would like a very loud and busy house. When it gets like that here sometimes, I get very nervous and worried. Mom thinks that maybe I was in a home with a lot of fighting and violence. Sometimes I'm not sure if people are playing or fighting, and it makes me very scared. Mom reassures me that everything is OK, and makes everyone calm down.\n\nOh, I forgot to mention. Mom stays at home! I'm lucky because now that my big sister is off to college, and my 10 year old brother is back in school, I get a lot of time with Mom! I don't have to go in that crate too often!\n\nSo far, I've been great with dogs my size and smaller dogs, we aren't sure about cats, because we don't have any. Mom thinks I would probably be OK, but could possibly need some correction.\n\nWhen we go on car rides, I ride VERY well. In fact, I usually lay down and go to sleep!\n\nIf you want to know more about me, ask Mom, she knows a lot about me!\n\nAll STAR animals come vetted, Up to Date (UTD) on age appropriate shots and testing, spay and neutered (if of age,) and microchipped.\n\nAGE DISCLAIMER:\nUnfortunately, most of the orphaned animals that come into our rescue looking for homes don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring birth certificates. Sometimes we know our pets\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ages. Sometimes we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. So we make our best guess based on the condition of their teeth and the veterinarians best guess.\nBREED DISCLAIMER:\nVisual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality,\nnot\nby breed label .\nMicrochips:\nFor the safety of our dogs and peace of mind of our fosters and adopters, STAR microchips all dogs prior to adoption with Petlink Microchips. Please understand that all dogs MUST still wear a collar with ID tags (which include your current information) AT ALL TIMES. Please remember, our foster dogs are extremely important to us-- we will always take any of our dogs back, if for any reason you can't keep your adopted dog. Never surrender him/her to a shelter!\n\n4/18/18 3:06 PM"

We do not have a central facility. If you want to meet any of our adoptables please submit an application.\n\nHi! My name is Sheldon and I'm looking for something called a \"family!\" My foster mom told me about them and I think it sounds perfect!\n\nI used to live at this place called animal control and it was really noisy and scary there. I hated it because I was locked up for nearly the entire day in a small cage. Sometimes a nice volunteer would take me outside to go potty but there are lots of other dogs there like me and sometimes there wasn't enough time in the day to let everyone out. I tried everything I could think of to get the attention of the visitors to let me out and maybe take me home, but none of it worked.\n\nI was so thankful when my foster mom took me home because I don't have to live locked up and I get to play and I can go outside whenever I want to. I even have foster siblings to play with.\n\nMy foster mom says that I am full of love and would make a perfect pet for an active family. I love riding in the car and she says I'm getting better on my leash. I'm very smart and know some basic commands and I can't wait for my family to teach me more. If you have any questions about me or would like to meet me, please fill out an application for me on our website www.savingtailsanimalrescue.org or email my foster mom any questions. heather@savingtailsanimalrescue.org\n\nThank you for considering a rescue pup like me!\n\nSheldon & Heather\n\nAll STAR animals come vetted, Up to Date (UTD) on age appropriate shots and testing, spay and neutered (if of age,) and microchipped.\n\nAGE DISCLAIMER:\nUnfortunately, most of the orphaned animals that come into our rescue looking for homes don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring birth certificates.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a Red Tick Coonhound and about 4-5 years old. I have a sad story about how I ended up in rescue, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to focus on that because life is great now!! I was malnourished when I first came to my foster home, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve fed me really well and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m now at a perfect weight; about 59lbs. I am very loving and friendly. Really, I love everyone; adults, kids, other dogs. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty good with the kitty that lives in my foster home too, but I will bark at and chase cats that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. My favorite pastimes include getting petted as much as possible, snuggling on the couch, hogging the bed, playing with my foster-brothers, singing the song of my people and chewing bones. I will tolerate being in a crate, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not my favorite place. I would love to find a home with someone who isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gone for long hours at work and maybe has another dog because I love the companionship of another fur-kid, or human kids because I adore them! However, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d also be perfectly happy being an only spoiled baby to my human family kids or not. I do have a medical condition, which is that I have seizures. My foster-mom and the vets aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure why, but I am on medications to manage them and will have to take them probably for the rest of my life. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let it get me down though, I love life and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait to find my forever family!! If you are interested in adopting me or have any questions, please email my foster mom at\n\njennawinans@savingtailsanimalrescue.org\n\nAll STAR animals come vetted, Up to Date (UTD) on age appropriate shots and testing, spay and neutered (if of age,) and microchipped.\n\nAGE DISCLAIMER:\nUnfortunately, most of the orphaned animals that come into our rescue looking for homes don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring birth certificates.

In my foster home, I get along well with my 3 fur siblings and kids too. I would enjoy another dog my size to play with(I'm 25#) or play chase, however I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do fine being the only dog too! I am only 1 years old and am mostly housetrained. When you are away, I do best left uncrated in a safe doggie area, as currently, if I am crated or confined, I get nervous and will urinate a little in my un-sureness. When left out in a doggie safe area, I will hold going to the bathroom until my foster mom gets home from work(10 hours). I sleep with my foster mom at night as I LOVE to snuggle and I hold going to the bathroom all thru the night. I enjoy going for walks, laying outside, running after tennis balls, gnawing on elk and playing with dog toys. What are you waiting for, make me a part of your family and apply for me, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll thank you with tons of kisses and cuddles!\n\nYOUR APPLICATION NEEDS TO BE SUBMITTED IN ORDER FOR PROCESSING TO BEGIN.\n\nAll STAR animals come vetted, Up to Date (UTD) on age appropriate shots and testing, spay and neutered (if of age,) and microchipped.\n\nAGE DISCLAIMER:\nUnfortunately, most of the orphaned animals that come into our rescue looking for homes don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring birth certificates.

We do not have a central facility. If you want to meet any of our adoptables please submit an application.\n\nGemma is a 4 year old, 45# mountain curr/lab/boxer mix. She is a little shy at first with new people but warms up super quick. She is a smart girl and is also potty trained. She enjoys playing with her doggie toys or having someone throw a ball around in a fenced-in yard for her to chase after.\n\nShe is gentle with the 7 year old boy she currently lives with at her foster home and they have a blast playing together. She is a sweet girl, who is a great mix of playful and cuddly and sleeps thru the night. She does well crated while her foster mom is at work for 8-11 hours and enjoys sleeping in a humans bed at night.\n\nShe takes treats gently and knows sit. She recognizes her name and responds to it. She also listens to tones of voice very well. She enjoys sniffing around in a fenced yard or in short bursts running in it with a doggie toy.\n\nAlthough she lives with other dogs at her foster home, she is dog selective and would require very slow intro's. Her ideal home she would be an only dog or paired with a laid back, calmer dog. She would not be a good candidate to take to dog parks. She would be fine going on walks, but will need some leash training. She also requires a fenced in yard, 3-4 foot chain link is fine, she won't jump the fence but does enjoy going out and just sniffing around.\n\nIf your looking for a dog to play ball with, cuddle up to a movie, hang out at the house with or take on neighborhood walks, apply for this true gem named Gemma!\n\nAll STAR animals come vetted, Up to Date (UTD) on age appropriate shots and testing, spay and neutered (if of age,) and microchipped.\n\nAGE DISCLAIMER:\nUnfortunately, most of the orphaned animals that come into our rescue looking for homes don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring birth certificates.

We do not have a central facility. If you want to meet any of our adoptables please submit an application.\n\nHi! My siblings and I are looking for our forever home. We are 6 weeks old and my foster mom said I will be ready to go to a new home in about 2 weeks. We are friendly and playful. If you are interested in adopting me, please fill out an application. If you have any questions, you can email my foster mom at\n\nheather@savingtailsanimalrescue.org\n\nAll STAR animals come vetted, Up to Date (UTD) on age appropriate shots and testing, spay and neutered (if of age,) and microchipped.\n\nAGE DISCLAIMER:\nUnfortunately, most of the orphaned animals that come into our rescue looking for homes don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring birth certificates. Sometimes we know our pets\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ages. Sometimes we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. So we make our best guess based on the condition of their teeth and the veterinarians best guess.\nBREED DISCLAIMER:\nVisual breed identification in dogs is unreliable so for most of the dogs we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix. We get to know each dog as an individual and will do our best to describe each of our dogs based on personality,\nnot\nby breed label .\nMicrochips:\nFor the safety of our dogs and peace of mind of our fosters and adopters, STAR microchips all dogs prior to adoption with Petlink Microchips. Please understand that all dogs MUST still wear a collar with ID tags (which include your current information) AT ALL TIMES. Please remember, our foster dogs are extremely important to us-- we will always take any of our dogs back, if for any reason you can't keep your adopted dog. Never surrender him/her to a shelter!\n\n4/18/18 3:06 PM"

He loves to go for walks and is doing really well at not pulling. He still will not go potty on lead but maybe with more time that will change. Once he discovered the dog beds he decided that he kind of liked those. He also enjoys toys, tossing them around in the air and shaking them is Greyt fun. He does not want to share them, but will now allow me to take them from him. He is a very affectionate boy, he loves children, but with very little ones I would keep a close eye on him. \nBadger is a special needs boy, but this problem is not anything life threatening. He has dry eye. This is in his right eye and only takes 5-10 minutes 3x a day to take care of. He is very good when this is being done. He will crate easily and does enjoy sleeping in the bedroom with you at night. Storms do not seem to bother him. So if your looking for a special boy to add to your family you will absolutely want to meet this handsome boy."

Due to her rough start, Nikki can be very skittish for awhile while she warms up to her humans. She does take time and patience. Now that shes warmed up to her foster family, she loves to give some good Roo's and greet them! She loves her two husky foster siblings very much too! Because of her skittishness, a home with small children would not be the best fit for her. She would love a nice, quiet home to live out her life filled with love and patience. She is not cat tested. She does have congenital eye issues most likely since birth, that the Veterinarian does not seem concerned about. She has difficulty with depth perception, but has her vision and has no cataracts or signs of anything that would cause pain or disruption to her life. She just walks a little crooked on walks sometimes, especially if something moves fast and startles her. \nIf you are looking for a dog you can create a special bond with, and love and cherish, Nikki is your girl. If you're interested in giving her her furever home, please fill out an adoption application at www.hhshr.com!"

ANSWERS TO MOST QUESTIONS CAN BE FOUND HERE! We are all volunteers with limited time to respond to emails; if your question involves something NOT addressed at \"Let's Get Started!\", we will respond ASAP!\n\n*WE NEED AN ADOPTION APPLICATION TO START THE PROCESS*\n\nJet is a gorgeous, playful guy with a big smile!  He is thought to be a Flatcoat Retriever mix (or possibly a Labrador Retriever with a bit of Border Collie thrown in!), just 9-10 mos. old and 43#.  Jet loves to run & play with his foster siblings, and he is the *master* of playing fetch! He is very smart, enjoys learning and listens well; but his previous life didn't include much training, so in addition to what he's learning with his foster family, he would benefit greatly from manners class!  Jet loves every person he meets, and will jump up to give kisses (his foster family is working on this).  Also, Jet's may accidentally knock down littler kids in his excitement to greet them, but would be fine with respectful kids 10+up.  Jet is doing well with crate-training, house training, and walking on a leash too!  Jet's name really fits him -- he is fast and would be great/have a blast at agility classes! Jet's ideal family would be active and provide him with a consistent routine/structure, regular exercise and play/cuddle time to help him really shine!"

There is no way to know for certain what any dog's breed mix is without a DNA test; and most mixed-breed dogs may have 3, 4, 5 different breeds in their mix!\n\n2. MUST READ --THE FIRST STEP: Go to www.barkbarkwag.org and click on \"Let's Get Started!\" to learn about our easy 3-step adoption process & apply to adopt! ANSWERS TO MOST QUESTIONS CAN BE FOUND HERE! We are all volunteers with limited time to respond to emails; if your question involves something NOT addressed at \"Let's Get Started!\", we will respond ASAP!\n\n*WE NEED AN ADOPTION APPLICATION TO START THE PROCESS*\n\nTobie is a sweet and spunky little man!  He is apx. 9 y/o and 11#.  He is fully-vetted including a dental, and is heartworm negative. Tobie is a little doll who loves to snuggle on the couch next to his humans.  He enjoys going for a few walks each day, and likes to run & relax in the fenced yard with his foster siblings when the weather is warmer!  He has a great appetite and enjoys treats, and chewing on tiny edible Nylabones!  He also loves playing fetch, especially with squeaky toys, and is great at it!  An ultrasound showed that he has very mild/controlled kidney issues, possibly caused by some type of trauma to his lower back (years ago); this doesn't hinder his movement in any way (see Tobie's video!)  The only result is that he has some reduced ability to sense when his bladder is completely empty. (He has no problem doing his business, he does both types easily and stops peeing when he senses he's \"done\", but he often \"dribbles\" once back inside).  He is receiving monthly acupuncture treatments, which seem to be helping to restore his feeling a bit more each visit! :)\n\nTobie wears a washable belly band (a wide piece of padded fabric around his midsection, easy on/off with velcro) in case of accidents, and he is meticulous about grooming himself.  Our wonderful vet showed us how to gently apply pressure to his lower belly/bladder when he's outside (by wrapping our hands around his lower body and giving a gentle \"squeeze\") to make sure he is empty.  Tiny Tobie loves baths, and he has one in the sink, quick and easy once a week, to make sure he is extra clean.  He does fine with other dogs, especially those his size; but may chase cats.  Though Tobie is good with respectful kids he has met, an adult home would be his dream! \nHe is a spunky little guy, and a perfect mix of snuggly and independent... he would love to be your napping buddy or walking buddy :)"

There is no way to know for certain what any dog's breed mix is without a DNA test; and most mixed-breed dogs may have 3, 4, 5 different breeds in their mix!\n\n2. MUST READ --THE FIRST STEP: Go to www.barkbarkwag.org and click on \"Let's Get Started!\" to learn about our easy 3-step adoption process & apply to adopt! ANSWERS TO MOST QUESTIONS CAN BE FOUND HERE! We are all volunteers with limited time to respond to emails; if your question involves something NOT addressed at \"Let's Get Started!\", we will respond ASAP!\n\n*WE NEED AN ADOPTION APPLICATION TO START THE PROCESS*\n\nCandy is a beautiful and gentle girl... She is approx. 10 years young, 43#, and is a Lab/Border Collie mix.  Candy was with her human dad since she was a puppy... he recently passed away, and she was lost with nobody else in the world :(   We are honored to have Candy with us at Bark Bark Wag, and her foster family has been working hard to help Candy smile again!  Candy is housebroken and crate-trained (though she absolutely does not need to be crated -- she is an angel!).  Candy has a gentle and polite way about her, and she doesn't ask for much -- she is happy to just spend time with her family.  She knows several commands and loves going for walks -- she doesn't pull and is very gracious on lead. Candy has been fine with the other dogs she has met; cats unknown.  She loves all humans, and is good with respectful kids  (ages 10  & up)...  though we are looking for a calmer, adult home for Candy given the recent loss of her human and the many changes in her life. Candy loves to sleep in her dog bed in the bedroom, or on the humans' bed if invited; her energy level is moderate.  She greets every day with a smile, and has the happiest wag and wigglebutt we've seen in a long time!  Candy would be a dear and comfortable companion for a very lucky family."

There is no way to know for certain what Nellie's breed mix is without a DNA test, so we have no way to know whether or not this dog is \"hypoallergenic\".  Since she is a mixed breed, and could have as many as 4-5 breeds in her mix, it is safest to assume this dog is NOT hypoallergenic.\n\n2. MUST READ --THE FIRST STEP: Go to www.barkbarkwag.org and click on \"Let's Get Started!\" to learn about our easy 3-step adoption process & apply to adopt! ANSWERS TO MOST QUESTIONS CAN BE FOUND HERE! We are all volunteers with limited time to respond to emails; if your question involves something NOT addressed at \"Let's Get Started!\", we will respond ASAP!\n\n*WE NEED AN ADOPTION APPLICATION TO START THE PROCESS*\n\nNellie is 5-6 years old, 15#, and thought to be a Poodle mix.  She is a very sweet and affectionate girl, who is looking for a very special type of forever family. Nellie is very fearful of strangers to the point she will \"shake in her boots\" and hide. She needs to meet a person several times to be comfortable with them. Once she is, she loves to be on your lap and get belly rubs.\n\nNellie is a stay-at-home kind of girl who doesn't enjoy traveling/car rides, meeting new people or going for long walks (she is starting to enjoy shorter walks in the fenced yard to build her confidence).  Nellie is looking for an adult family who spends a lot of time at home and has a moderate energy level. She has done great with children, though a family who only has them visit would be best...  a lot of activity with kids coming and going makes her nervous.  Nellie has become very attached to her foster mom, and will follow her anywhere; so a woman is most likely to be her new best friend.  Nellie is house-trained and crate-trained; she spends most of her day free-roaming in her foster home, and has not been crated when no one is home, she is not destructive in any way. \n\nNellie's prospective family will need to meet her at least twice in her present foster home; please do not apply for Nellie if you can't commit to a slower \"getting-to-know-you\" period prior to adoption.  Nellie will need a loving, patient family who is willing to let her be the dog she is, and not push her to meet new people or go on outings; allowing her to build confidence at her own pace. She is smart and takes treats gently, food snacks may be the way to her heart when teaching new things.  Nellie is a very quiet, sweet, and loving girl who would also benefit from a very \"friendly/socially confident with people\" dog companion, who is a mellow, gentle player.  Nellie enjoys snuggling with and hanging out with a best dog friend, as well as with her human family!"

He knows 'sit' so far, loves treats, and is crate-trained/housebroken.  Dustin came from a home who left him and his 2 fur siblings/fur mom behind in a rural area when they moved :( (He and his mom/siblings all get along great)!  Dustin does best with female dogs of his own size, but tends to be hesitant or fearful meeting new dogs, especially males or larger dogs; he isn't quite sure about (or interested in) cats. Dustin walks on a leash nicely and doesn't pull, but he is also not confident on a leash since he has had very little to no practice. Dustin clearly loves people/kids and enjoys living with a family; he has been great with respectful children 10+up.  He does well in his foster family's fenced yard, but will bark at dogs who approach the fence.  Dustin loves everyone he meets and would love to just be someone's snuggle buddy and walking companion once he has gained more confidence about going on outings.  Dustin would thrive with a loving family who will work with him, and give him new experiences to help build his confidence.  He would be most comfortable as an only dog (or to be adopted with one of his siblings who he is already used to -- Shayla and Daisie will be listed soon!)."

There is no way to know for certain what any dog's breed mix is without a DNA test; and most mixed-breed dogs may have 3, 4, 5 different breeds in their mix!\n\n2. MUST READ --THE FIRST STEP: Go to www.barkbarkwag.org and click on \"Let's Get Started!\" to learn about our easy 3-step adoption process & apply to adopt! ANSWERS TO MOST QUESTIONS CAN BE FOUND HERE! We are all volunteers with limited time to respond to emails; if your question involves something NOT addressed at \"Let's Get Started!\", we will respond ASAP!\n\n*WE NEED AN ADOPTION APPLICATION TO START THE PROCESS*\n\nAdorable Amelia is thought to be a mix of Mastiff and Boxer.  She is 10# and 9 weeks old as of 4/12/18!  Pupvana.com's puppy calculator predicts that Amelia and her 2 siblings will be 60-75 lbs. at 1 year of age.  Though she is a typical playful pup, Amelia is the most sensitive of her siblings; she has a gentler, more thoughtful way about her.  She is so sweet -- she loves to be held, and will tuck herself into your arms for a good snuggle. These kids are healthy, inquisitive and playful pups! All are working on crate and housetraining, and learning about the all sights & sounds in their foster home :) Adoption preference will be given to families who plan to attend puppy manners classes with their new puppy!\n\n\n"

She is apx. 3 years old, 17#; and we believe her to be a Beagle/Toy Fox Terrier mix.  Trixie is a super-sweet girl who loves to cuddle.  Even though she is really fast when running & playing, she is generally a calmer girl.  Trixie enjoys the company of other dogs for playing or naptime, but we don't know if she likes cats or not.  She loves being with her people, and adores sleeping in the humans' bed every chance she gets!  Trixie is housebroken and crate-trained.  She loves playing outside and enjoys walks, but car rides make her a little nervous and she will hide her face.  Trixie's perfect home will have a physical fenced yard so she can run and play, and a similar-sized canine playmate would really make her day (but this is not mandatory).  She would love a family who loves to snuggle and spend time playing with her -- she has so much love to give!"

There is no way to know for certain what any dog's breed mix is without a DNA test; and most mixed-breed dogs may have 3, 4, 5 different breeds in their mix!\n\n2. MUST READ --THE FIRST STEP: Go to www.barkbarkwag.org and click on \"Let's Get Started!\" to learn about our easy 3-step adoption process & apply to adopt! ANSWERS TO MOST QUESTIONS CAN BE FOUND HERE! We are all volunteers with limited time to respond to emails; if your question involves something NOT addressed at \"Let's Get Started!\", we will respond ASAP!\n\n*WE NEED AN ADOPTION APPLICATION TO START THE PROCESS*\n\nJade is a beautiful brown color with light eyes; she is 3-4 years old, 38-40# and believed to be a mix of Chocolate Lab and a smaller breed (or two)!  She is a sweetheart, and is friendly with everyone she meets.  Jade loves to be with her people, no matter what they are doing.  She is crate-trained, housebroken, and loves to go for walks! Jade will also join in a game of fetch, and enjoys playing with toys or a nice cuddle on the couch. She does well with other dogs her size (she is a little too rowdy/action-packed with smaller dogs); and has done fine with less playful adult cats who are used to dogs. She has been good with kids in her foster home 10+ up; she may be fine with slightly younger kids too.  Jade is an easy keeper who just goes with the flow.  Jade was heartworm positive, and has been treated while in foster care with us.  She is in the post-treatment stage, where she needs 6 weeks of low activity and some crate rest, which would give her new family plenty of time to bond with her, cuddle on the couch watching movies, etc.  Once this rest period is over, her new family can expect a loving girl who will go for short (or long!) walks, or just enjoy some outside time playing fetch and soaking up the sun. Jade knows \"sit\" so far, walks well on a leash, and is very treat- motivated; she is a smart girl and would love to learn more with a loving forever family!"

              "$t": "Meet Winnie! She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Jack Russell Terrier Mix who weighs in at approximately 14lbs. She is just a little over 7 years old. Winnie was rescued just days before Christmas from the shelter. She was sadly part of a neglect case where the previous owner had stopped feeding her. She was only let out of her small crate to roam the streets to find food, even in the freezing cold. Even though she was neglected, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the sweetest dog. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very mild mannered, comes when you call her name and can sit! She loves to play fetch and tug of war. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a big cuddle bug who is always near her foster mom. \n\nThat being said, Winnie does have some mild anxiety when left alone, she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t not like to be crated and is not 100% potty trained yet. She is looking for a quiet, loving home with another dog friend for her to play with. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also can be a little skittish, so a home with older children or no children is best. Winnie also has epilepsy and will require her new home to give her medication two times a day and to have regular bloodwork done to ensure her medication is working. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to meet Winnie please email Wag because she will not be there every weekend. \n\nWinnie is spayed, microchipped, dewormed, on heart worm and flea preventative, and up to on her vaccines.\n\nWinnie may not be at our adoption events but his Foster Mom is available for \"meet and greets\" during the week. If interested in Winnie, please fill out an application. \n\nOur adoption fee is $250.00 (cash or credit card)\n\nThis sweetheart will be at the Livonia PetSmart on Saturdays from 11-3. Come up and meet this cutie. The Livonia PetSmart is located at South East corner Middlebelt and I-96 at 13150 Middlebelt Rd Livonia, MI 48150. It is located in the back of the Meijer and Costco Parking lot. Our pets are in the back right hand side of the store past the grooming and vet clinic.

              "$t": "Meet Rico 2, an approximately 1 year old Chihuahua mix, owner surrender. He's about 7 lbs right now and could stand to put on another pound.\n\nRico is an adorable little guy who loves to cuddle! He is hand shy at first but once he's had some time to adjust to you he'll be your best friend forever! He loves cuddling on the couch with his foster mom and snuggling under the blankets when it's time to go to bed. Rico will need a family who is patient and willing to work with a pup who's instincts have him hiding under the bed instead of running up to greet friends and neighbors. For this reason, Rico would not do when in a home with children under the age of 8.\n\nRico is not fully house trained and we are working on this. He does not do well in a crate but has not showed any destructive tendencies when left to roam the house while his foster mom is away. Rico would benefit greatly from having a fenced in yard, although this is not required. Rico is fostered with other dogs and does well with them but would benefit from a slow introduction given his timid nature.\n\nRico is currently up to date on vaccines,  heartworm & flea preventative and dewormed. He is scheduled to be fixed and microchipped prior to adoption.\n\nOur adoption fee is $250.00 (cash or credit card)\n\nThis sweetheart will be at the Livonia PetSmart on Saturdays from 11-3. Come up and meet this cutie. The Livonia PetSmart is located at South East corner Middlebelt and I-96 at 13150 Middlebelt Rd Livonia, MI 48150. It is located in the back of the Meijer and Costco Parking lot. Our pets are in the back right hand side of the store past the grooming and vet clinic.  We ask that you DO NOT contact PetSmart about our animals. They are kind enough to provide space for our adoption events, but are not involved with our rescue work. Please email us if there is a specific puppy/dog you would like to meet to be sure they will be at the adoption event.\n\n\nIf you would like to apply for this dog or any of our other dogs, please request an application by clicking the \"Adopt Me\" or \"Contact This Organization\" button or email waganimalrescue@yahoo.com.\n\n Or you can go to our web page at WagAnimalRescue.com  an click the Adopt  to fill out an application. http://waganimalrescue.com/dog-application/\n\nOr email all 21 questions listed below with detailed answers to waganimalrescue@yahoo.com\n\nThe information that you provide on the application will help us determine whether the dog that you have chosen is a good match for you so please give as much detail as possible.

              "$t": "Doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he have the sweetest face and tender brown eyes! \n\nSweeney is just a small fella (13 lbs.) with the perfect combination of spunk and love. We think he is a Chihuahua/Beagle mix.   He is crate trained and will go in his crate when asked. Walks very good on a leash in his harness but can sometimes frightens with sirens or loud cars.  His favorite spot is near you or on your lap. You would never guess that he is nine years old (Chihuahuas can live as long as 20 years).  He can be shy at first but will come out of his shell quickly, especially when a squeaky toy is involved.  \n\nSweeney is dog selective and can be a bit bossy with other dogs.  He would prefer to be your only lap dog.  Young children can make Sweeney nervous.  A forever home with older (12 or older) or no kiddos would be best. \n\nSweeney lost both of the humans he loved within two years of each other.  He soon found himself in an animal shelter. It was determined that Sweeney had luxating patella\u00e2\u0080\u0099s of both of his knees.  But WAG came to his rescue and had surgery on both of his knees February 7th this year.  He also had his teeth cleaned is doing great.  \n\n\nChihuahua/Beagle Mix\nBlack w/Tan\n9 years old on January 1\n13 pounds\n\nOur adoption fee is $250.00 (cash or credit card)\n\nThis sweetheart will be at the Livonia PetSmart on Saturdays from 11-3.

              "$t": "4/18/2018\n\nDaisy is an adorable 9 week old puppy that has a sister named Lily. We believe she is a Lab/Pit Bull mix, but we're not exactly sure. We think she's half cute and half adorable! Daisy loves attention and to play. She likes to give kisses and craves attention! She is learning her manners right now and is very much an active puppy.\n\nLily and Daisy are bundles of cuteness that spend hours chasing each other around and exploring the big new world. We believe they will be at least 50lbs full grown, but we're not exactly sure. They would do best with another active dog to help burn off some of their puppy energy. They are at the chewing stage so caution needs to be taken in making his environment safe. They are not house trained so will need someone willing to train them. They will need to go outside many times a day; about every half hour. \n\nTheir new home will REQUIRE A PHYSICAL FENCED yard. Please no apartments or condos. Because of their size they would do best in a home without small children under the age of 6. They would not do well being locked up for 8 or more hours a day. They need a home with someone willing to enroll them in training courses. They are fostered with other dogs and they do great with them. \n\nDaisy is up to date on vaccines, dewormed, on flea & heartworm preventative and is micro-chipped. \n\nOur adoption fee is $250.00 (cash or credit card)\n\nThis sweetheart will be at the Livonia PetSmart on Saturdays from 11-3. Come up and meet this cutie. The Livonia PetSmart is located at South East corner Middlebelt and I-96 at 13150 Middlebelt Rd Livonia, MI 48150. It is located in the back of the Meijer and Costco Parking lot. Our pets are in the back right hand side of the store past the grooming and vet clinic.  We ask that you DO NOT contact PetSmart about our animals. They are kind enough to provide space for our adoption events, but are not involved with our rescue work. Please email us if there is a specific puppy/dog you would like to meet to be sure they will be at the adoption event.\n\n\nIf you would like to apply for this dog or any of our other dogs, please request an application by clicking the \"Adopt Me\" or \"Contact This Organization\" button or email waganimalrescue@yahoo.com.\n\n Or you can go to our web page at WagAnimalRescue.com  an click the Adopt  to fill out an application. http://waganimalrescue.com/dog-application/\n\nOr email all 21 questions listed below with detailed answers to waganimalrescue@yahoo.com\n\nThe information that you provide on the application will help us determine whether the dog that you have chosen is a good match for you so please give as much detail as possible.

              "$t": "4/18/2018\n\nLily is an adorable 9 week old puppy that has a sister named Daisy. We believe she is a Lab/Pit Bull mix, but we're not exactly sure. We think she's half cute and half adorable! Lily loves attention and to play. She likes to give kisses and craves attention! She is learning her manners right now and is very much an active puppy.\n\nLily and Daisy are bundles of cuteness that spend hours chasing each other around and exploring the big new world. We believe they will be at least 50lbs full grown, but we're not exactly sure. They would do best with another active dog to help burn off some of their puppy energy. They are at the chewing stage so caution needs to be taken in making his environment safe. They are not house trained so will need someone willing to train them. They will need to go outside many times a day; about every half hour. \n\nTheir new home will REQUIRE A PHYSICAL FENCED yard. Please no apartments or condos. Because of their size they would do best in a home without small children under the age of 6. They would not do well being locked up for 8 or more hours a day. They need a home with someone willing to enroll them in training courses. They are fostered with other dogs and they do great with them. \n\nLily is up to date on vaccines, dewormed, on flea & heartworm preventative and is micro-chipped. \n\nOur adoption fee is $250.00 (cash or credit card) which includes a $50 spay deposit that will be refunded once she is spayed.\n\nThis sweetheart will be at the Livonia PetSmart on Saturdays from 11-3. Come up and meet this cutie. The Livonia PetSmart is located at South East corner Middlebelt and I-96 at 13150 Middlebelt Rd Livonia, MI 48150. It is located in the back of the Meijer and Costco Parking lot. Our pets are in the back right hand side of the store past the grooming and vet clinic.  We ask that you DO NOT contact PetSmart about our animals. They are kind enough to provide space for our adoption events, but are not involved with our rescue work. Please email us if there is a specific puppy/dog you would like to meet to be sure they will be at the adoption event.\n\n\nIf you would like to apply for this dog or any of our other dogs, please request an application by clicking the \"Adopt Me\" or \"Contact This Organization\" button or email waganimalrescue@yahoo.com.\n\n Or you can go to our web page at WagAnimalRescue.com  an click the Adopt  to fill out an application. http://waganimalrescue.com/dog-application/\n\nOr email all 21 questions listed below with detailed answers to waganimalrescue@yahoo.com\n\nThe information that you provide on the application will help us determine whether the dog that you have chosen is a good match for you so please give as much detail as possible.

Gyspy is available in southeastern Michigan within 1 hour of zip code of 48164.\n\nIf you would like to apply to adopt her, please visit our website listed below.\n\nGypsy is a sweet little gem that's shy to start but fun to love.   She's a 13 week old Bassador (Bassett Hound/Lab Mix).  She is crate training and doing great.  She was from a \"side of the road\" litter that was ditched off when the owner wouldn't pay the surrender fee to make sure they were safe in a local shelter.  She hails a Saints flag and is straight from New Orleans, but hasn't batted an eyelash about coming to live and play in Michigan snow.   She likes it here!\n\nShe has a longer hound type tail and when she wags - - her whole body wags and she whacks her tail off her own side like a drum in excitement.   She's shy when picked up but when snuggled holds on tight and giives the sweetest neck snuggles as she finds her comfort.   \n\nHer outside potty skills are perfection!  She barely takes steps away from you before her doing her business and then is quickly asking if it's okay if she plays since she's done what we expected.   \n\nIf you're willing to let her warm up for just a quick few minutes, you'll be surprised at her \"I know you\" personality and love.  \n\n\nGypsy's adoption fee is $300. \n\nAll dogs are up-to-date on age appropriate vaccines. All dogs  over 6 months of age are spayed/neutered and Heartworm tested prior to adoption. Puppies under 6 months of age are adopted out on spay/neuter contracts and must be fixed before 6 months of age.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and possibly adopting this great dog, please email adopt.nolalabrescue@gmail.com to request an adoption application (or download a copy from our website www.nolalabrescue.org), complete, save it for your reference and send to adopt.nolalabrescue@gmail.com.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We do not have a shelter where you can view our available dogs. All of our dogs live with foster families in private homes. You must complete an application and references will be checked by a volunteer before you can meet the dog. Please visit our website: www.nolalabrescue.org to learn more about our adoption procedures.\n"

              "$t": "If you are interested in meeting and adopting Skylor, please do NOT click the Petfinder Inquiry button - we would much rather our adopters visit our website, read our adoption requirements and process and apply using our application.\n\nSkylor is available for adoption within 1 hour of 48164.\n\nSkylor is a 5 year old pure-bred (not papered) German Shepherd who came to us from Louisiana as a heart worm positive owner surrender.  His owner was quite elderly and couldn't handle the 86# giant he is.   \n\nHe's actually quite gentle and easy going, but if you are in your eighties, it's understandable how he wasn't easy for her.   He knows some basic commands and is crate trained but frankly after 6 months of crate time during most of the day (his heartworm treatment time), he'd much rather have a home where he doesn't have to crate - he's only had to crate with us as \"activity restrictions required\".   He is house trained very well and has never had an accident.   He sleeps in bed with our kennel manager at night and his best friend is very senior blind poodle.  He gets along with most dogs in our home, but doesn't seem to really care for the energetic ones and tells us so.\n\nHe's good on a leash and great in home, though he did attempt to counter surf for goodies a few times but was immediately corrected to \"off\" from the counter and doesn't seem to do it anymore.  \n\nHe will sleep right in front of your door when he's tired as he doesn't want to miss someone coming in, but he doesn't really bark much and does really well with people of all sizes, including toddlers.   \n\nAfter being with us for 6 months, we are sure we will shed tears when Skylor finds his own forever home, but we are more than sure he deserves his own family and his own attention.    \n\nHe's heartworm negative (tested in April), up to date on vaccines, microchipped and neutered.  \n\nHe's an easy pick if you have no other animals and don't want to have to do house training or leash training, etc.  He's move in quality, but of course if there are other animals, we'd want to be sure it's a good match for him.  \n\nWe look forward the best-fit adoption application for our  sweet Sky!!  \n\n\nSkylor's adoption fee is $300. \n\nAll dogs are up-to-date on age appropriate vaccines. All dogs  over 6 months of age are spayed/neutered and Heartworm tested prior to adoption. Puppies under 6 months of age are adopted out on spay/neuter contracts and must be fixed before 6 months of age.\n\nIf you are interested in meeting and possibly adopting this great dog, please email adopt.nolalabrescue@gmail.com to request an adoption application (or download a copy from our website www.nolalabrescue.org), complete, save it for your reference and send to adopt.nolalabrescue@gmail.com.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We do not have a shelter where you can view our available dogs. All of our dogs live with foster families in private homes. You must complete an application and references will be checked by a volunteer before you can meet the dog. Please visit our website: www.nolalabrescue.org to learn more about our adoption procedures."

              "$t": "NOT FOR ADOPTION - BREED INFO ONLY!!!!!!!!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you see a dog like this, it is most likely an \"American Eskimo Dog\".  Some call them \"Spitz\", but that term  refers to a type of dog which can generally be identified by a tail that curls over its back.  Included in the spitz category would be the American Eskimo Dog, Husky, Keeshond, German Spitz and Pomeranian, just to name a few.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  American Eskimo Dogs tend to be reserved on first meeting, then become velcro, cuddle bunnies, lap doggies, glue...you get the idea.  They are intelligent, loving, devoted to their people, and love to be with you.  They generally live 15+ years and tend to be much more active and healthy into later years than some other breeds.  They are fun, playful, and LOVE to run!! Most require a fenced yard or the opportunity to run (safely) off leash on a daily basis.  They are watch doggies in that they will bark as arrivals or strange noises outside, alerting the family to trouble.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \"Eskies\", their common nick name, come in 3 sizes:  standard, mini and toy.  Although it is determined by height (about 9-12\", 12-15, 15-19) you can estimate by weight.  Under #10 will be a toy....may be a few pounds heavier but generally NOT more than #13, most MINIs are 10-20# maybe up to #22 at times....and about 20-35# would be a standard.  Some books say they can be up to #40, but most are not, and recent breeding has moved toward smaller, more delicate features.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Eskies are often confused with Samoyed, which are also a spitz breed but are larger, have a slightly different frame and shape and are more likely to weigh over #40.  I can guarantee that if it weighs #70, it is NOT an eskie!!!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Eskies do shed, but the better the diet, the more they shed seasonally, but they do shed and if you don't want some hair on the furniture, they are not the breed for you.  Most folks who meet, foster or babysit one fall in love with their natures because they are SO loving and total attention sponges who will suck up for some love at every opportunity.  My male loves to go visiting and make the rounds of everyone in the room.  Also, when you own such a beautiful dog, everyone stops to ask what breed it is, etc.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  HOWEVER, this is NOT the breed for everyone.  Some folks adopt one due to beauty alone and do not realize these dogs NEED and DEMAND your time.  They are a strong-minded breed and must be trained firmly, but never harshly.  They do NOT respond to harsh training methods at all and can be ruined by such treatment.  Also, as puppies, then can be little rambo puppies with rockets on their feet.  I know - I got my first as a puppy and hated him by 4 months!!  They are all go go go active bouncing zooming puppy who LOVES to chew and get in all sorts of trouble. If you don't find something for puppy to do, or leave him alone too long, puppy will make it s own games and you will NOT like them.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So, please DO NOT ADOPT an eskie just because they are gorgeous.  They can become wonderful, devoted and loving companions, but they are a handful as puppies....much more so than some other breeds.  Eskies are very puppish and I don't consider them adults until 3+ years, and they also do not get their full adult coat until then.  So,you may want to consider an excellent, playful, puppyish young one over a puppy, unless you do research and really know what you are getting in to.  That is why so many end up in pounds at 6 months to a year - folks who adopted them and have no patience, time or understanding of how to train them and turn them into excellent adults.  I myself prefer eskies that are 3+ and 5 is a wonderful age!!!! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Remember that eskies can live very healthy lives past 15+....some 18 years, so don't overlook the seniors out there!  I 've seen 14-15 year olds who bop all around, love walks, dance emphatically for treats, etc."

              "$t": "NOT FOR ADOPTION - BREED INFO ONLY!!!!!!!!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you see a dog like this, it is most likely an \"American Eskimo Dog\".  Spitz refers to a type of dog which can generally be identified by a tail that curls over its back.  Included in the spitz category would be the American Eskimo Dog, Husky, Keeshond, German Spitz and Pomeranian, just to name a few.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  American Eskimo Dogs tend to be reserved on first meeting, then become velcro, cuddle bunnies, lap doggies, glue...you get the idea.  They are intelligent, loving, devoted to their people, and love to be with you.  They generally live 15+ years and tend to be much more active and healthy into later years than some other breeds.  They are fun, playful, and LOVE to run!! Most require a fenced yard or the opportunity to run (safely) off leash on a daily basis.  They are watch doggies in that they will bark as arrivals or strange noises outside, alerting the family to trouble.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \"Eskies\", their common nick name, come in 3 sizes:  standard, mini and toy.  Although it is determined by height (about 9-12\", 12-15, 15-19) you can estimate by weight.  Under #10 will be a toy....may be a few pounds heavier but generally NOT more than #13, most MINIs are 10-20# maybe up to #22 at times....and about 20-35# would be a standard.  Some books say they can be up to #40, but most are not, and recent breeding has moved toward smaller, more delicate features.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Eskies are often confused with Samoyed, which are also a spitz breed but are larger, have a slightly different frame and shape and are more likely to weigh over #40.  I can guarantee that if it weighs #70, it is NOT an eskie!!!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Eskies do shed, but the better the diet, the more they shed seasonally, but they do shed and if you don't want some hair on the furniture, they are not the breed for you.  Most folks who meet, foster or babysit one fall in love with their natures because they are SO loving and total attention sponges who will suck up for some love at every opportunity.  My male loves to go visiting and make the rounds of everyone in the room.  Also, when you own such a beautiful dog, everyone stops to ask what breed it is, etc.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  HOWEVER, this is NOT the breed for everyone.  Some folks adopt one due to beauty alone and do not realize these dogs NEED and DEMAND your time.  They are a strong-minded breed and must be trained firmly, but never harshly.  They do NOT respond to harsh training methods at all and can be ruined by such treatment.  Also, as puppies, then can be little rambo puppies with rockets on their feet.  I know - I got my first as a puppy and hated him by 4 months!!  They are all go go go active bouncing zooming puppy who LOVES to chew and get in all sorts of trouble. If you don't find something for puppy to do, or leave him alone too long, puppy will make it s own games and you will NOT like them.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So, please DO NOT ADOPT an eskie just because they are gorgeous.  They can become wonderful, devoted and loving companions, but they are a handful as puppies....much more so than some other breeds.  Eskies are very puppish and I don't consider them adults until 3+ years, and they also do not get their full adult coat until then.  So,you may want to consider an excellent, playful, puppyish young one over a puppy, unless you do research and really know what you are getting in to.  That is why so many end up in pounds at 6 months to a year - folks who adopted them and have no patience, time or understanding of how to train them and turn them into excellent adults.  I myself prefer eskies that are 3+ and 5 is a wonderful age!!!! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Remember that eskies can live very healthy lives past 15+....some 18 years, so don't overlook the seniors out there!  I 've seen 14-15 year olds who bop all around, love walks, dance emphatically for treats, etc."

I am very active so I would love an active family that would take me on long walks. I love to give kisses and get my luvins!\n\nMy medical is all done: I'm UTD with my vaccines, neutered and microchipped. I am ready to go as you can see! \n\nWhat are you waiting for? Please fill out an adoption application on http://providingforpaws.org/adoption-and-foster-forms.html and mention ME Aristotle...the cute adorable little boy!"

              "$t": "Look at this hunk: Titan is a gentle giant. \n\nHe's about 70lbs and believes that he can fit in your lap. He's very sweet and loving. His favorite thing to do is cuddle up or play ball in the yard. Titan is a young adult, born sometime in 2013. Old enough to be out of the \"I'm gonna tear up the house stage\", but young enough to love life and all that it has to offer. Because he is so big, and has a tendency to want to rough house, we recommend kids 10 and up.  If you are looking for a boy who wants to play, this is your guy!\n\nTitan has been around other dogs and puppies. He likes most dogs he comes across, but can be selective!  He loves a good game, and most kitty's don't appreciate that, so we would recommend a home with out cats.\n\nTitan can be a little shy at first but once he is comfortable he's a very playful boy and would be a great addition to any family. Titan is a very big dog and loves to burn off his energy with a run or lots of play!\n\nIf you're looking for an oversized cuddle bug, then Titan is your boy. He is fully vaccinated, micro-chipped, neutered, heartworm tested and on monthly preventative. \n\nIf you can't wait to have Titan as a new family member then please visit http://providingforpaws.org/adoption-and-foster-forms.html to complete an adoption application."

She is very tiny but she'll gain some weight quickly with high quality food and of course lots of love from her foster mom! Her brother Frankie is also looking for a home!\nKoko is currently in a foster home with a German Shepherd, a Lab and a kitty and is doing great with all of them! She is very curious but her favorite thing is to be held and snuggle right into your arm.\n\nKoko started her vetting already: she had her first round of vaccines, dewormer and is having her boosters as well as spay in the beginning of May. She will also be microchipped.\n\nIf you're interested is Miss KOKO, please fill out an adoption application on: http://providingforpaws.org/adoption-and-foster-forms.html"

His mom has loved him since he was a puppy, but has nowhere to live except her car.  She is looking for a temporary foster home (30 days) while she works with MIworks and other agencies to get back on her feet.  \n\nMom may get into a shelter next week, but cannot take her dog.   The last few days have been cold!!!!   She slept in her car, but managed to get her dog into day care for a night.\n\nIf she can't get a stable home for Brody in a reasonable time frame, she will release him to rescue.  Mom has lost it all....except her dog.  Let's make sure she doesn't lose him, too!\n\nOur rescue will handle all coordination with the owner, etc.  Fully vetted, 3 yrs, purebred, neutered, housebroken.\n\nMust be near SE MI to foster.\nPlease contact asap!!"

Just recently, after a long battle with cancer, my mom passed. I am sad, but getting better. I am 11 years young! I do have a weak back end and can do a few stairs but will need help if there are many. This doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop me from getting where I need to go! Occasionally, I may have an accident if I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get to the door on time but not very often. I am up-to-date on my shots and do need eye drops but otherwise I am in good health. I love a good massage and just sitting and chillin\u00e2\u0080\u0099. I get along well with other dogs and kids. I would love to join your family! If you would like to adopt me just fill out an application at www.pugrescuenetwork.com. \n\nMy PRN # is 281 and my adoption fee is $75. \n\nIf you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t adopt me you can sponsor me or any of the pugs in rescue for as little as $1. \nInquire: curlytails@pugrescuenetwork.com \n\n\n"

All family members should be present for the application and the in-person interview with a member of our Adoption Approval Committee. All applications will require a home inspection prior to final approval.**\nA fenced yard may be required for bully breeds, and some dogs may require a household where all children are over the age of 5.***"

              "$t": "Moose is currently accepting applications from people interests in adopting him. He is 85lbs of pure awesomeness!. Moose wants you to know that he is going to be a little picky about who he chooses as his new family. He would prefer to live in a home without children or cats, even though he can get along with both. He is a big fan of buckwheat pancakes and he loves to watch Duck Dynasty while chewing on his favorite raw hide. He thinks it is funny!! He enjoys sleeping in the bed between his foster mom and dad and he is usually ready to go to bed around 8:30 pm. Moose made it to Safari Animal Rescue after one of their volunteers saved him from going on death row in another shelter. He is a mixed breed of possible coonhound/lab or maybe even Cumberland Spaniel, but without a DNA test, it's hard to tell.  He can sit, go down, shake and he will roll over to get a belly rub. He suffers from some allergies and has to take allergies pills to keep from getting too itchy. He is so happy to see people that he doesn't do well in a wire crate because he has happy tail. Moose needs a back yard to hang out in and he does well with other dogs. His foster home has 4 other dogs and 4 cats too, so he has a lot of company there. He is very loyal and gets attached to people he likes. He has been exposed to numerous dogs and people at his fosters home. Although he enjoys company he is not overly needy or pushy about getting affection and he can be left in the house with his foster sisters and brothers with no problem.\n\nBirthdate: 03/10/2009\n\nVisit SAFARI's website www.safarianimalrescue.org for a full listing of adoptable animals. Please check out the Upcoming Events menu for a list of upcoming adoption events.\n\n**Please contact us before an adoption event, to verify that the animal you are interested in will be in attendance. \n\n***At this time we are unable to accommodate out of state adoptions, or adoptions outside the metro Detroit area. Information requests on any of SAFARI's animals should be directed to us via email. With the call volume we receive, we are unable to return all inquiry phone calls due to time restraints. Listed breeds are a best guess based on animal appearance, and should in no way be considered a guarantee of breed.\n\nSpecial Animal Friends and Rescue, Inc. (SAFARI) is a non-profit, no-kill,  foster based animal rescue. SAFARI is currently seeking foster parents, volunteers, and donation to fund the continued rescue of these deserving animals. \n\n**Please note: SAFARI requires all applications to be submitted in person at an adoption event. All family members should be present for the application and the in-person interview with a member of our Adoption Approval Committee. All applications will require a home inspection prior to final approval.**\nA fenced yard may be required for bully breeds, and some dogs may require a household where all children are over the age of 5.***"
